Bitcoin becomes a global hedge - Bitcoin thrives as a decentralized asset amid AI-driven geopolitical instability and institutional mistrust. Flight to digital safety grows as AGI becomes centralized. 25%\n2. Bitcoin is tightly regulated but survives - Governments clamp down due to AI-enabled surveillance and economic control, but Bitcoin remains usable in sanitized form. Regulated exchanges dominate.\t35%\n3. Bitcoin is banned or deplatformed in major jurisdictions - AI-driven regimes (e.g., US, China) deem it a security risk or capital flight vector. Mining becomes highly restricted or illegal. Usage goes underground. 15%\n4. Bitcoin forks or fragments - Disagreements over how to adapt (e.g., post-quantum security, privacy, compliance) cause a contentious fork. One branch favors state compliance, another goes cypherpunk. 10%\n5. Bitcoin becomes obsolete due to AGI-native money or better cryptos - AGI develops new financial protocols or currencies (e.g., AI-optimized chains or internal economies), making Bitcoin outdated in performance or integration. 15%\n\nI had never considered number 5 before, but AI creating a better alternative to bitcoin does seem like a real existential threat.", "content_size_bytes": 1400}

Any attempt to somehow build on an infinite number of forks because double-signing is possible (whereas in PoW it is impossible) will not lead to the honest majority following along, as those \"alternative forks\" will never become the \"longest\" (in terms of least skipped) chain. So in order to actually pull of an attack based on that you have \"nothing at stake\" you need to be the majority, i.e., >51%. Whenever you are the majority, you are already free to attack the network as you want as nothing protects it against 51% attack, the security model in Nakamoto consensus (or traditional solution to Byzantine Generals Problem) is an *honest majority*. Given this, you can also notice that the reason Satoshi used PoW was *not* because double-signing was impossible, it was probably primarily because it has random validator selection built in (whereas with proof-of-stake you need to also solve random number generation), and much like the ancient Greeks Kleroterion it is the \"democratic lottery\" that was the basis of Nakamoto consensus. Bootstrapping a proof-of-stake system back in 2009 would have been a lot more complicated. From that you can notice that those who shouted about \"nothing at stake\" because \"there was something at stake in PoW\" may have misunderstood things, they assumed the \"no double signatures\" was somehow essential but it was probably not the feature that made PoW ideal for a first version of \"democratic lottery\" to control a computer platform.", "content_size_bytes": 1702}

I am the inventor of Bitpeople (dot) org that was invented between 2015 and 2018 in collaboration with \"bitnation\" (I since distanced myself from \"bitnation\" because their vision is wrong, I can specify how if anyone is interested). It was originally called Virtual Pseudonym Parties or Online Pseudonym Parties, then for a short time Pseudonym Pairs. I also built a people-vote consensus engine a year and a half ago (under my Swedish foundation Panarchy foundation that also develops Bitpeople), and have now spent half a year solving the \"reserved payment attack\" in multiphop payments (this is not under my foundation, it is part of a separate and older project called Resilience as it required such a solution).\n\nThe \"Achilles heal\" in Bitpeople is the man-in-the-middle attack and this has been very openly communicated since 2020-something probably. There are many different ways to solve it (i.e., to establish a secure channel). I have left the problem open over the past 5 years or so, and prioritized things such as\n\nI think one of the most secure might be the \"lock & key\" video chat handshake. It is quite simple. Both people in the pair commit (encrypt and share with the other person) a video plus their public key. At this point, the two people know absolutely nothing about one another, as they are registered with laundered keys that cannot be traced to the previous month's event. They then do the video event, and after, they reveal their committed video + public key.\n\nA bit like a \"hash lock\" but with video. I have considered similar ideas over past 5 years, and wanted to mention it here if anyone is interested.\n\n***On the \"but AI\" issue:*** *1-on-1 video chat is the most secure \"digital Turing test\" there is. Of course, a hypothetical science fiction technological singularity would break it but then such a system could grow a retina more easily or probably build replica androids indistinguishable from people too so at that point most proof-of-unique-human systems collapse anyway - I only mention this science fiction scenario as some people here believe it is already real, and those people typically tend to believe the neuron-transistor analogy, that biology settled for transistors that are 10000x the diameter of our technological ones and that Moore's law somehow did not apply in biology, but I do not think that is a reasonable assumption at all. Rather the transistor is probably protein-scale, like tubulin which is 4.5x8 nm. I love AI, use it all the time and have been very interested in it since Watson won Jeopardy in 2011.*", "content_size_bytes": 2585}

The weather was fine, and the daily APY was thicc! the scams and rug pulls were there, but a lot more thought had gone into these projects. Ahhh OHM, TIME, STRONG.. take me back! Around 17,000 Alt coins existed back in those days (meaningful) with many of them dead. Liquidity was juicy after the COVID crash and the choice of alts to invest in MUCH smaller. Alts would pump 10x in a few hours. Launchpads were the real alpha and APY plays made you feel like you were really about to retire in a few weeks! Alas for many, it was simply moving liquidity to the early adopters.\n\nFast forward. It’s July 2025, we’ve had sunshine for a week in the UK and BTC.D is looking like it’s about to make moves. Many Altcoin moonbois from 2021 are now BTC maxis having joined the halls of BTC Valhalla with the once 2017 Altcoin moonbois! \nWhat’s left, a somewhat hopeful, slightly delusional and most certainly deep in the red group of crypto bros praying a 2025 AC Szn will set them free. \n\nAt the end of 2021 around 400k tokens had been born, lived and died. By the end of 2025 it’s estimated there will have been nearly 100 million tokens created. As of today it’s believed there are hundreds of thousands of active / alive projects\n\nThink about that number, think about how much liquidity is needed to nourish hundreds of thousands of projects this Altcoin season, draining liquidity - spread thin like butter. There simply isnt enough liquidity in the market to feed the hunger of all.\n\nSadly, MANY legitimate, great projects will see no more than maybe a 1-3x top 100s may see 50% to 1x.\n\nThis fabled Alt season will be like spreading butter over the world’s largest piece of toast.\n\nI ofcourse hope you all get back to break even.

The current dominant interface to blockchain —non-custodial wallets—remains too complex for the average person.

But since the rest of your ADA was in rewards, you couldn’t send that portion until it was withdrawn.*  \n   \n*Because your wallet had no remaining ADA after sending out the original staked ADA, there wasn’t enough to cover the transaction fee required for withdrawing rewards. That’s why you had to send a small amount of ADA back into the wallet first.*  \n   \n*Once you did that, you were able to withdraw the rewards from your stake address into your regular wallet address, making them fully spendable.*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nHey guys,  \nI ran into a weird situation using Yoroi wallet and wondering if anyone else has experienced this or found a solid workaround.\n\nTL;DR:\n\n* I had some ADA staked and accumulated a handful of ADA as staking rewards.\n* I went to withdraw rewards, and got prompted to participate in Cardano governance \n* I chose \"Abstain\" to keep things simple.\n* I was able to successfully undelegate and withdraw the principal, but the rewards are still sitting there.\n* Now, if I click on the “Withdraw” and “Undelegate” buttons, they dont do anything , and I can’t send the rewards because they don't appear in the sendable “Assets” section.\n* So my ADA in rewards are effectively stuck \n\n# Note:\n\n* Yoroi shows the staking rewards correctly in the wallet summary.\n* I confirmed I selected an on-chain governance option (Abstain).\n* I have enough ADA in the wallet to pay fees.\n* Refreshed the app, restarted browser, no luck.\n\nAssistance appreciated!", "content_size_bytes": 2132}

We just assume we'll be different, we'll be the profitable ones, even though statistically 93-95% of leverage traders lose money.\n\n**Why This Actually Matters:**\n\nThere was some data published recently showing Nolus users hit $1.8M in realized PnL with <5% liquidation rates (on-chain data), and it made me realize how rare it is to see platforms actually share these numbers. Most don't want you to know because the aggregate performance is probably terrible. The truth with Nolus is that it's a platform that earns fees through open positions, and that's why it has features that protect positions from being liquidated during short/long squeezes.\n\nThink about it - traditional platforms (CEXs) often make money when you lose money. Liquidations = their revenue. If 80% of users are losing, that's not a bug, it's a feature for them. Popular decentralized platforms like Hyperliquid (which doesn't directly benefit from liquidations, I think) have traders' PnL of... -$75M! Platforms with good user outcomes will show you the data. Positive aggregate realized PnL, low liquidation rates, verifiable on-chain performance. Platforms that don't talk about this data... well, you can probably guess why.\n\nDo you actually research platform-wide user performance before using leverage protocols? Or do we all just YOLO in assuming we'll beat the odds that everyone else is facing? Because honestly, if a platform can't show me that their users are actually making money collectively, why would I expect to be any different?\n\n**P.S.** Since I mentioned Nolus, there's a campaign live at the moment. By opening a position and getting +10% PnL, you're eligible for a $25 USDC reward. Sorry for no link, but I respect the sub's rules.", "content_size_bytes": 1970}

The idea of connecting Telegram’s huge user base with EVM-compatible DeFi is ambitious, but the way they’re going about it, through hybrid dApps and user-first design, makes it feel realistic.   \n  \nWhat really caught my attention, is how deep Bitget is leaning into this. It’s not just a listing, they’ve already backed TON-native tokens like $DOGS, $BLUM, $NOT, and $MAJOR, and now they’re bringing $TAC into the ecosystem with full wallet support, DeFi tools, and direct dApp access through Bitget Wallet. On top of that, Bitget dropped a $30 million investment into TON earlier this year to drive GameFi and Tap-to-Earn trends, so this isn’t just hype, there’s serious infrastructure and long-term vision behind it. And with the CandyBomb campaign now live (up to 9M $TAC in rewards), it’s a perfect time to get involved whether you’re just exploring or already holding.   \n  \nSeeing this level of alignment between a protocol and an exchange gives me more confidence in TAC protocol's long-term potential, especially in the TON-powered Web3 space that’s really starting to gain traction.  \n  \nAnyone else keeping an eye on it?

You will retain 97% of your ETH upside\n\nNow, you can deposit the minted USDA+ stablecoin at dCDS and farm option fees yields and ETH price gains from all the other hedgors like you.\n\nThis way you get to farm ETH gains without worrying about it falling down.\n\nThe project is backed by investors and audited rigorously.", "content_size_bytes": 1704}

Do we even perceive the world as it is, especially being that we only see and hear a fraction of what cameras and microphones can detect?\n\nThat we ask such questions, is objectively logical. Our answers however — tend to be subjectively logical. And that is what pricelessly **distinguishes uniquely human work** from the work of any computer or robot.\n\nMeaning, we humans are indelible to and inseparable from our context as a human. Said another way: We, cannot, be perfect — especially given that we exist with a partial image of existence.\n\nWe will always be some kind of…human, with human priorities, and human faults.\n\nThe beauty of this AI takeover, disgusting as it may be to endure, is how quickly we’ve grown an **appreciation for these quirks.** Background noise in a podcast for example, is now a welcome signal of humanity. A happy little mark of the beast, if you will.\n\n**We can even use our quirky sense of reality as a faster, better Turing test.** “Strawberries” uses the letter ‘r’ 3 times by our eyes, but usually 2 times according to most AI models (and phonetics, which isn’t itself spelled phonetically but I digress).\n\n…and that, that right there - is exactly what secures our uniquely human work into the future, in alliance with AI.\n\nIts very nature to perceive with literal exactness of its own context — the simple fact it is easily confused if you say John and Jill went down the hill instead of the exact published phrasing — is **WHY we humans ultimately have complete job security.**\n\nYou need to know how to communicate as an expert in order to direct AI to generate expert results.\n\nIt can learn faster than humans, sure. But even with perfect translation from layman prompt to expert output it still lacks our experience, our context, and our discernment; **our inherent needs and drive to serve, to create, and to love** which thusly advance more and better experiences and contexts.\n\nIn order to expertly improve for humans, one must be an expert human — even with AI.\n\nJust like hunting, and what President Truman put on the sign on his desk: the buck stops here.\n\nThis inundation of AI content is growing our discernment and ability to stop the buck — and, can grow our self-esteem if we let it. We can choose to live in a **sense of awe and appreciation for humanity when we see it** and cherish that we can **more readily recognize the love and service which went into that** creation. And be proud of ourselves for **acting out of love and service** of human creation.\n\nSaid another way: humans make typos. Humans have to pee in the middle of the livestream. Humans live in the world and the world doesn’t wait for yard work.\n\nAnd we can choose to love it, and simply focus on becoming **e**xperts on what we love in order to flourish in this age of AI — in alliance with it.\n\nStay cozy,\n\nThe Pirate Ninja Fairy Queen and White Knight Heartbreaker, herself", "content_size_bytes": 3274}

The latter seems to be much more prominent as of late. With all that said, what if I told y’all that realistic optimism is a thing?\n\nThere’s no doubt that we are in a rough spot in our nation and world history. The rise of right wing Christo-nationalism and fascism are spreading, on top of the climate crisis and various other issues we face as a species. The harsh truth is that nothing is promised in this world. People have suffered, are suffering and will continue to suffer. This may sound fucked up, but we were never entitled to have an era of hope and good feelings forever. That’s naive and anti-historical in its nature. Throughout history, there have always been prosperous eras and negative eras as history is very cyclical in nature. We’re currently in a rough spot/negative era. The reality is that progress and history are not linear. This phenomenon is exacerbated by the fact that most of the people lamenting that we are “cooked” are young and don’t have the life experience or historical background to look more objectively. That’s exactly what realistic optimism aims to do. Acknowledging the harsh reality of the situation while still providing hope that we can get out of this. A nuanced look at reality.\n\nThe best thing about all of this? We can make optimism a thing by actually working for progress, but also recognizing the grim and harsh realities that I pointed out in my previous paragraph, without losing sight of the big picture and giving into doom. That can be achieved by working for progress and better outcomes. That's the nature of realistic optimism.", "content_size_bytes": 1970}

I thought you might like it.\n\nThe **Optimist Creed** is a set of principles developed by Christian D. Larson in his 1912 book *Your Forces and How to Use Them*. It has been widely adopted by organizations like Optimist International, inspiring individuals to maintain a positive outlook and focus on personal growth and service to others. Below is the creed with an explanation of each line:\n\n# 1. Promise Yourself To be so strong that nothing can disturb your peace of mind.\n\n* **Meaning:** Develop mental resilience and inner strength. Cultivate confidence, focus on personal growth, and practice mindfulness to stay calm and centered in challenging situations.\n\n# 2. To talk health, happiness, and prosperity to every person you meet.\n\n* **Meaning:** Spread positivity through your words and actions. Encourage others with optimism and a hopeful outlook, which can uplift their spirits and yours.\n\n# 3. To make all your friends feel that there is something in them.\n\n* **Meaning:** Recognize and affirm the strengths and value of those around you. Offer genuine compliments and support to help others feel appreciated and empowered.\n\n# 4. To look at the sunny side of everything and make your optimism come true.\n\n* **Meaning:** Focus on the positive aspects of situations, even during difficulties. Use optimism as a tool to manifest hope and better outcomes in your life.\n\n# 5. To think only of the best, to work only for the best, and to expect only the best.\n\n* **Meaning:** Set high standards for yourself and maintain a constructive mindset. Pursue excellence in your goals and expect success, which can help you overcome challenges.\n\n# 6. To be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own.\n\n* **Meaning:** Celebrate others’ achievements with genuine joy and encouragement. This promotes collaboration, reduces envy, and strengthens relationships.\n\n# 7. To forget the mistakes of the past and press on to the greater achievements of the future.\n\n* **Meaning:** Let go of regrets and learn from past mistakes. Focus your energy on what you can achieve in the present and future, rather than dwelling on what went wrong.\n\n# 8. To wear a cheerful countenance at all times and give every living creature you meet a smile.\n\n* **Meaning:** A positive demeanor can inspire and comfort others. Smiling and exuding warmth helps to foster a welcoming and uplifting atmosphere.\n\n# 9. To give so much time to the improvement of yourself that you have no time to criticize others.\n\n* **Meaning:** Concentrate on personal growth and self-reflection. Avoid negativity and judgment, which can distract from your own progress and peace of mind.\n\n# 10. To be too large for worry, too noble for anger, too strong for fear, and too happy to permit the presence of trouble.\n\n* **Meaning:** Rise above negative emotions by focusing on what truly matters. Develop emotional intelligence, practice gratitude, and maintain a positive perspective even during difficulties.\n\nThis creed serves as a powerful guideline for living a fulfilling, optimistic life while inspiring kindness and growth in others.", "content_size_bytes": 3233}

Cómo ZK permite que redes de infraestructura del mundo real (IA, computación en la nube, gaming) se construyan sobre la blockchain, creando un mercado más eficiente y justo.\n* **La Prueba de Mercado:** Analizo por qué la reciente migración de un gigante como **Aethir** (que potencia a plataformas como **CARV**) a una red ZK nativa (**Sophon**) es una señal económica y estratégica que no podemos ignorar. Los grandes jugadores están haciendo sus apuestas.\n\nHe condensado toda esta investigación en un video documental que intenta conectar todos estos puntos de una forma visual y narrativa.

Memory Storage Layer**  \n- **Type**: *Sharded, encrypted graph database* (like a blockchain + IPFS hybrid).  \n  - **Data Structure**: Each user’s memory is a Merkle DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), where nodes are encrypted \"memory blocks\" linked contextually.  \n  - **Storage Specs**:  \n    - **Per-block size**: ~10KB (compressed text + metadata).  \n    - **Throughput**: 1M blocks/sec globally (requires petabyte-scale NVMe caches).  \n    - **Encryption**: XChaCha20-Poly1305 (quantum-resistant, faster than AES).  \n\n **2. Privacy Layer**  \n- **Anonymization**:  \n  - *Monero-style ring signatures* mask which user owns which memory blocks.  \n  - *zk-SNARKs* prove \"I have a prior chat about X\" without revealing X.  \n- **Access Control**:  \n  - **Private Keys**: Hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets (like Bitcoin BIP-32), but for memory blocks.  \n  - **Biometric Fallback**: Secure enclave-backed face/fingerprint auth to recover keys.  \n\n **3. AI Inference Layer**  \n- **Context Fetching**:  \n  - When you say \"recall our convo about pizza,\" the AI sends a *zk-proof* to the network requesting matching blocks.  \n  - Only blocks you decrypt locally are fed into the model’s context window.  \n- **Hardware**:  \n  - **User Device**: Light client (e.g., M2 Ultra chip for on-device decryption).  \n  - **Server Side**: TPU clusters with *fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)* support to compute on encrypted blocks.  \n\n---\n\n**Speculative Tech Dependencies**  \n| **Component**         | **2024 Status**               | **2030 Projection**                     |  \n|-----------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|  \n| **zk-SNARK Speed**    | ~1s/proof (Groth16)         | ~10ms/proof (Plonk++ with ASICs)      |  \n| **FHE Practicality**  | 1000x slower than plaintext | Only 10x slower (TFHE optimizations)  |  \n| **Decentralized Storage** | IPFS (slow retrieval)   | *Ceramic Network* w/ sub-second latency |  \n\n---\n\n **User Flow Example**  \n1. **You**: \"Remember my pizza preference from last time?\"  \n2. **System**:  \n   - Your device sends a zk-proof asserting: *\"I have a block tagged ‘food’ signed by key X.\"*  \n   - Network returns the encrypted block (never seen by servers).  \n   - Local GPU decrypts → feeds into AI’s context: *\"Ah, you love pineapple pizza!\"*  \n\n---\n\n **Hardware Requirements**  \n#### **User Device (2030)**  \n- **Minimum**:  \n  - **CPU**: 8-core ARM v12 (with FHE accelerators).  \n  - **RAM**: 24GB LPDDR6 (for in-memory decryption).  \n  - **Storage**: 1TB optane-like NVM for block caching.  \n- **Ideal**:  \n  - **Dedicated NPU**: For zk-proof generation (~50 TOPS).  \n  - **Secure Enclave**: Apple T-series or equivalent.  \n\n **Network Infrastructure**  \n- **Memory Nodes**:  \n  - **Storage**: 100TB+ NVMe-oF (NVMe over Fabric) per node.  \n  - **Bandwidth**: 400Gbps RDMA (for low-latency block fetching).  \n- **AI Servers**:  \n  - **TPUs**: 6th-gen, optimized for FHE (hypothetical \"FHE-TPU\").  \n\n---\n\n **Challenges to Solve**  \n1. **Energy Use**: zk-proofs + FHE could spike compute needs 1000x. *Solution*: Photonic chips or reversible computing.  \n2. **Metadata Leaks**: Even encrypted, access patterns reveal info. *Solution*: *Oblivious RAM (ORAM)* techniques.  \n3. **Adoption**: Users hate managing keys. *Solution*: Social recovery (e.g., 3 friends can reset your key).  \n\n---\n\n **Why This Could Work**  \n- **User Trust**: No corporation controls your memory; you’re the custodian.  \n- **AI Utility**: Retains context across sessions *without* surveillance.  \n- **Regulatory Safe**: GDPR/CCPA-compliant by design.  \n\n---\n\n **Prototype Roadmap**  \n1. **Phase 1 (2025)**: On-device encrypted memory (Signal-style).  \n2. **Phase 2 (2027)**: zk-proofs for private context fetching.  \n3. **Phase 3 (2030)**: Fully decentralized, FHE-compatible AI.  \n\n---\n\nThis isn’t just tech—it’s a *philosophical shift* from \"AI as a service\" to \"AI as an extension of personal agency.\" The hardware *will* catch up if the demand exists.  \n", "content_size_bytes": 4338}

It fell long ago but the animals that moved in have become intelligent and delightfully strange. If you catch or tame one (sheep love delicious Ethereum) they will provide bonuses to actions, adventure, and combat as your pets.\n\nYes, the sheep do combat. Some have knives and they've got a mean kick.\n\nSheep minted during the promo will remain in user wallets and become available as in-game pets when the game launches on-chain. Because wallets are neat like that! (We restarted the test server a few times (Sepolia sheep) and accidentally brought our testnet minted pets with us in the test player wallets)\n\nRelevant links. Hype my sheep! Join the game! SHEEEEEEP!\n\nP. S. There are also custom NFT rats and cottages in the game, in addition to these awesome sheep.  \nDaggers and Wands coming soon.\n\nAsk me about my gaaaame!", "content_size_bytes": 1737}

I started out as a developer maintaining a legacy .NET app with infrastructure in AWS. That’s where I first got interested in cloud architecture, which eventually led me down the AWS certification path and into more formal infrastructure and DevOps roles.\n\nI’m deeply interested in cryptocurrencies because of their potential to decentralize and democratize transactions. I am venezuelan, and in 2017/2018 I was able to send money to my family through [localbitcoins.net](https://localbitcoins.net/) in a very difficult time when all international transactions were blocked, Cryptocurrencies were (and still are) a lifeline for many people. Btw, I truly recommend [https://whycryptocurrencies.com/](https://whycryptocurrencies.com/), really good lecture, it really inspired me to start working on this project.\n\nUntil I started this project, I felt wary of cold wallets, mostly because I didn’t really understand how they worked internally. I never felt comfortable with anything other than MetaMask (though I’m not a huge fan of storing keys in browser storage either). Another app I used a lot is LemonCash, which functions more like an exchange, letting you use crypto and automatically convert it to pesos while supporting different tokens, so I decided to build a desktop cold wallet in Go, something that sits between both applications.  \n  \n Investigating about frameworks I ran into wails, and I decided to start building the HD wallet, not to create a product but to learn in the process and get familar with the industry.  I've been building it since January, in the beginning I thought of supporting a few tokens (like USDC, ETH, BTC, SOL).  At the moment I have only managed to build the ETH infrastructure, but this has turned into the side project I’ve stuck with the longest.   \n  \nUntil now, I’ve been building it quietly and sharing progress within my personal network. But with the amount of time and thought I’ve put into it, I felt it was time to open it up to the community, get feedback, and maybe even find people interested in contributing.  \n  \nHere’s the repo: [https://github.com/deaconPush/ubiDist/tree/main/wails/wallet](https://github.com/deaconPush/ubiDist/tree/main/wails/wallet), and here is a video with a basic [demo](https://files.catbox.moe/x8pzhr.mp4).   \n  \nIt’s still rough around the edges, and as it is my first Go project the structure is still pretty raw. I’ve been focusing on keeping the architecture flexible and avoiding overengineering. So far, I’ve implemented a basic UI to create and restore wallets, store data in a SQLite DB, and send ETH transactions to other accounts using the local Hardhat network. Next steps include improving security, adding integration tests, helpful logging, and starting to add support for new tokens.  \n  \nI’ve always been a big fan of open source but never had the self-confidence to contribute, maybe this is my way into that world.\n\nThanks for reading, happy to connect with like minded engineers/crypto enthusiasts!\n\n", "content_size_bytes": 3110}

Chainless Apps rethink dApp architecture from first principles. What Are Chainless Apps?  \nChainless Apps separate execution from trust and settlement. That’s the core idea.  \nInstead of being tightly coupled to a blockchain for every state change, Chainless Apps execute off-chain, prove correctness using verifiable computation (zkVMs, AVSs, or TEEs), and settle via the Agglayer into Ethereum.  \nThis enables:\n\n* Web2 responsiveness\n* Web3 verifiability\n* Seamless cross-chain UX\n\n Architectural Overview  \nChainless Apps are composed of four distinct, modular layers:\n\n1. **Execution Layer** – App-specific, off-chain logic that runs at native speed.\n2. **Trust Layer** – Flexible verification options (zkVMs like RiscZero/Succinct, AVSs via EigenLayer, or TEEs).\n3. **Bridge Layer** – Unified asset/message routing via the Agglayer.\n4. **Settlement Layer** – Anchor trust proofs to Ethereum (or the Agglayer itself in the future).\n\nEach application gets its own execution and trust environment, while inheriting Agglayer’s unified bridge and settlement layer. This allows for high throughput, lower cost, and superior UX — without sacrificing verifiability. Trust That Scales  \nWe don't dictate how apps establish trust — we give you a menu:\n\n* **zkVMs (e.g. RiscZero, Plonky3)**: Cryptographic proofs of correctness\n* **AVSs (e.g. EigenLayer)**: Committee-based attestation\n* **TEEs (e.g. Intel SGX)**: Hardware-secured execution\n\nDevelopers choose the model that best fits their application’s needs. The system is modular from day one. The Role of Agglayer  \nAgglayer connects Chainless Apps to the rest of Web3:\n\n* **Unified Bridge**: Native routing for assets and messages across chains\n* **Pessimistic Proofs**: Prevent over-withdrawals and race conditions\n* **Fast Interop (coming soon)**: Sub-second messaging between chains\n* **Proof Aggregation (coming soon)**: Bundle ZK proofs across apps to minimize L1 cost\n\nThe result is a shared liquidity layer across applications and chains — composable, verifiable, and synchronized. \n\nProof-of-Concept: zkSpot\n\nWe built zkSpot to demonstrate what Chainless Apps unlock.  \nIt's a high-performance spot exchange that runs app logic inside a TEE, then proves correctness via zkVM. With fast settlement, native asset support, and Agglayer routing, zkSpot behaves like a CEX — but is verifiable like a DEX.  \nThis model generalizes to any interactive or high-throughput app:\n\n* Real-time games\n* Social protocols\n* Prediction markets\n* Enterprise dashboards\n\n**Learn More**  \nThis work builds on prior concepts like A-Z apps and modular rollup architecture.

This is the [point at infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_at_infinity) in the projective representation of the curve, which has no representation in the usual (x, y) coordinates.\"\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/8cgl9a/ethereum\\_private\\_key\\_with\\_all\\_zeroes\\_leads\\_to\\_an/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/8cgl9a/ethereum_private_key_with_all_zeroes_leads_to_an/)\n\nI also found discussion on twitter that says the same thing happens with the n value of secp256k1.\n\nI wanted to see what would happen if I started generating child keys to this address and started checking their balances. I was also curious if there was some way I could use the child keys to generate a  mnemonic phrase that included the masterkey but apparently that's getting it backwards.\n\nI used Claude to help me of course. After some discussion it helped me generate the code and even added a balance checker. Later I had to start again in a new window and Claude was refusing to help me because it was convinced I was trying to steal peoples funds. I was later able to convince it that I was testing the security of the burn address and it was happy to continue to help me. I added changes to give some prefilled choices of chaincode.\n\nI have deployed the code on cloudflare pages here:\n\n[https://eth-edge-case-tests.pages.dev/](https://eth-edge-case-tests.pages.dev/)\n\nHere is also the codepen:\n\n[https://codepen.io/j354374/pen/ogXxqjE](https://codepen.io/j354374/pen/ogXxqjE)\n\nand github repo:\n\n[https://github.com/aptitudetechnology/eth-edge-case-tests](https://github.com/aptitudetechnology/eth-edge-case-tests)\n\nSo far I haven't found any funds or any way to sign transactions with the masterkey but I have learned a lot in the process.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or suggestions", "content_size_bytes": 2249}
