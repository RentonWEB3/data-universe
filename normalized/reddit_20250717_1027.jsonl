Wanted to introduce myself as the co-founder of Markball and start an open chat about our mission to bring professional footy to the US. We're planning three matches this fall with exact dates and location coming soon, and we'll be paying our players in Bitcoin!\n\nI lived in Melbourne 10 years ago and was blown away by footy the first night I arrived. I was a clueless American fresh off a long flight, went out to a pub, and caught a finals match on TV. I had no idea what I was watching but I couldn't look away. The pace, the chaos, the hits, the skill, the rabid fans at the 'G and all around me glued to every second of the action. It was unlike anything I'd ever seen. Since then, one question has been stuck in my head. Why has nobody in the US heard of this sport?\n\nThe reality is most Americans still have no clue it exists. And that's a shame because everything about it checks the boxes for what we love over here. Nonstop action, big collisions, high scoring, real endurance and toughness. Every time I show a clip to someone here, they have the same reaction I did. First a few minutes of disbelief, then they're all in. But with games on in the middle of the night and no pro clubs in the states to follow, their love fades fast. I've made it my personal mission to change that.\n\nI've spent years thinking through how. Talking with athletes, league execs, sports investors, and startup folks. Many late nights brainstorming with Fox Footy on. Eventually we decided the best path was to build something from scratch and launch it in a way that feels like we're introducing an entirely new sport. Even though footy has nearly two centuries of history, it's completely unknown to 99% of Americans and we're approaching it like a brand new concept. But we wanted a name that still felt familiar and honors what makes the sport amazing. We landed on Markball, a nod to one of footy's most iconic plays and also something every American understands. Catching a ball.\n\nWe're doing a few things differently, including paying players in Bitcoin and baking a crypto mindset into our brand DNA as a symbol of how we're building. Bold, independent, nontraditional, and undeterred. We can't take the same approach more established sports leagues do because we have a unique challenge here. But we know American fans want something different. Something faster, rawer, and with more action than other sports that currently exist here. They may not know it yet, but they're searching for Markball.\n\nI get that this won't be for everyone. Footy is a proud sport with deep tradition and strong roots. But that's what makes it worth fighting for, and we believe the ceiling in the US is way higher than people think. We're trying to finally give the sport a proper professional home here.\n\nWould love to hear some thoughts. Open to all feedback, support, skepticism, new ideas. We've spent a ton of time mapping this out, but we know it's still early and there's a long road ahead. If you want to follow along, check out our socials that just launched @ PlayMarkball. We'll be posting more content and updates there. And if you have any questions, I'll be here.\n\nThanks for reading and hope to have your support as this takes shape over here!\n\ntl;dr\n\n* Markball is a new pro sport inspired by Aussie Rules Footy, built for U.S. fans.\n* Launching with 3 matches this fall — details coming soon.\n* Born from the question: *Why don’t Americans know about footy?*\n* Rebranded for a fresh start, with a name that highlights its most iconic play.\n* Crypto-native from day one — players get paid in Bitcoin.\n* Built for chaos, action, and highlight culture.", "content_size_bytes": 3677}

What course of mathematics is bitcoin investing strategies based upon? \n3. Why do bitcoin enthusiasts seem to reject the material origins of money and commodity production and exchange?\n\nI love that the bitcoin community shows fervor in wanting everyone to be financially independent and \"thrive\" under capitalism. However, this fervor promptly comes to an end with a pessimistic conclusion: \"people need to just be smarter, like me!\" The capitalist system won't allow for the vast majority of people in societies worldwide, who happen to be workers, exploited and subjugated by the ruling class, to be free of its stranglehold. \n\nI worry that combining religion and/or spirituality with a committed detachment of material history of how economic relations have developed up to the present day is grounds for yet more alienation from each other, and also extreme idealism. It's saying, \"I don't need to know about how things work, i just need to trust that capitalism will sort things out in my favor.\" \n\nDavid Graeber is no help. He has pointed out only that work under capitalism is bad, and completely gives up on a way forward for the working class. He holds disdain for historical materialism, and has no sense of global economic relations. Because he thinks workers are stupid, there's no wonder why he doesn't think the working class is capable of self-organizing and expropriating the wealth of the fortune 500 companies and running the economy in the interests of the majority. \n\nThe stock exchange is very interesting but it is still owned by the ruling class, and decides the fate of millions of people.

I’m 23 and I’ve been deep down the Bitcoin rabbit hole for a while now. Not just because I think the number’s gonna go up, but because I genuinely believe the U.S. currency system is broken. I don’t trust fiat, and Bitcoin feels like the only real long-term play.\n\nRight now I’ve got about $8,500 in Bitcoin and $8,500 in a high-yield savings account. Around $7,000 of that is my emergency fund, but I’ve been seriously thinking about just moving it into Bitcoin. I know it’s risky and goes against most advice, but it feels wrong to leave it sitting in cash when I believe so strongly in BTC.\n\nI’m also:\n\t•\tPutting 15% of my income into a retirement account, and\n\t•\tDCA’ing 15% into Bitcoin\n\nLately I’ve been thinking about cutting retirement down to just the company match and throwing the rest into BTC. My mindset is: I’m 23, I’ve got time to recover if I make mistakes, and I want to make the most of this window while I’m young.\n\nStill, I don’t want to be reckless. So here’s what I’m asking:\n\t•\tHas anyone here actually kept their emergency fund in BTC?\n\t•\tIs pulling back on retirement to go harder on BTC a bad idea?\n\t•\tIf you were 23 again, knowing what you know now — what would you do?\n\nAppreciate any real, honest feedback.

I pay my taxes 4 times a year usually, and I didn't pay once or even keep an accurate income log. Did not put enough aside. \n\n- Being self employed comes with alot of risk.

Daily, weekly, monthly, or triggered by price drops?\n2. Do you use any tools or indicators to time your buys? Are you purely automatic, or do you adjust based on market sentiment?\n3. How do you budget for your DCA? Do you ever pause or increase contributions based on life events or market conditions?\n4. Do you track your DCA performance? If so, what do you use?

{"uri": "https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1m1686f/is_the_nothing_at_stake_problem_exaggerated/", "datetime": "2025-07-16T07:24:29", "source": "REDDIT", "label": "ethereum", "content": "Given a rule that `(blockheight-skipped)` is treated equivalent to \"length\" or \"total difficulty\" in proof-of-work, and assuming fixed slot time, the validators will converge on the chain that has the majority of validators. Any attempt to somehow build on an infinite number of forks because double-signing is possible (whereas in PoW it is impossible) will not lead to the honest majority following along, as those \"alternative forks\" will never become the \"longest\" (in terms of least skipped) chain. So in order to actually pull of an attack based on that you have \"nothing at stake\" you need to be the majority, i.e., >51%. Whenever you are the majority, you are already free to attack the network as you want as nothing protects it against 51% attack, the security model in Nakamoto consensus (or traditional solution to Byzantine Generals Problem) is an *honest majority*. Given this, you can also notice that the reason Satoshi used PoW was *not* because double-signing was impossible, it was probably primarily because it has random validator selection built in (whereas with proof-of-stake you need to also solve random number generation), and much like the ancient Greeks Kleroterion it is the \"democratic lottery\" that was the basis of Nakamoto consensus. Bootstrapping a proof-of-stake system back in 2009 would have been a lot more complicated. From that you can notice that those who shouted about \"nothing at stake\" because \"there was something at stake in PoW\" may have misunderstood things, they assumed the \"no double signatures\" was somehow essential but it was probably not the feature that made PoW ideal for a first version of \"democratic lottery\" to control a computer platform.\n\n**Edit:** \"balance attacks\" is what many assume is detrimental if there is \"nothing-at-stake\". With the fork choice rule `(blockheight-skipped)` and fixed slot times (and assuming a validator order is pre-decided for a \"period\" of N blocks or days or similar), even starting such an attack (managing to get two forks that partition the validator pool) requires that the attacker has two slots in succession. This happens fairly often for attacker that is something like 5-15% of all stake. The attacker then has to skip two slots on the honest chain, X+1 and X+2 while  creating an attacker chain where they claim that the honest validator at block heigh X skipped their slot. At block height X+2, the attacker chain will then have a score of 1 point more than the honest chain. The automatic fork choice rule will then cause part of the validator pool to start to follow the attacker chain. Then, the attacker can try and do a \"balance attack\" by skipping slots selectively on whichever fork starts to get more and more validators to converge on it. To achieve this attempt at an attack, the attacker first has to pay two slots (i.e., not get block reward for two slots) and they then have to continuously pay slots as they skip slots to attempt to maintain a \"balance attack\".\n\nThe way \"nothing at stake\" is typically described, it is assumed most of the validator pool will simply choose to build on all possible forks and not use the fork choice rule (i.e., use a modified client that skips the fork choice rule and accepts all forks as valid). This assumption seems completely wrong. But, a \"balance attack\" is theoretically probably possible, but that is not where emphasis is usually placed when \"nothing-at-stake\" problem is described. The \"balance attack\" seems extremely convoluted, and being able to somehow \"steer\" a validator pool partition so that there is never convergence on one fork seems a bit like trying to sail against the wind. My post here was downvoted into oblivion (actually an 18% upvote rate at the moment! and there was at least a number of upvotes so that is quite a few downvotes on an already invisible post!), but to me it seems like the problem might be exaggerated. So-called \"slashing\" or some kind of penalty can of course deter it, if the problem is realistic, and that is already used with PoS Ethereum. But to me the threat does seem exaggerated.\n\nAnd to consider spontaneous forks that an attacker can operate on to do \"balance attacks\", the emergence of such spontaneous forks is low probability to start with. It requires one validator to be \"near the deadline\" when publishing their slot, so that the next validator assumes they skipped, and it requires that the next validator was allocated two slots in succession. Then, the fork will start to attract validators from the validator pool via the fork choice rule. Such a situation is low probability, meaning most forks for \"balance attacks\" have to be initiated manually at a cost of two skipped blocks (and no guarantee of successful attack, as such attack does not seem easy at all, and has a constant cost from having to skip blocks as that is the *only way to balance points* between the two forks).\n\nFactor in the fork choice rule that given equivalent \"points\" it is the smaller block height that wins, and the probability of a spontaneous fork is even lower. It is not nothing but it is very small, so most \"balance attacks\" would have to be manually initiated forks, and then you have a cost of two skipped blocks to start with, with no guarantee of a successful attack, and unclear gain from succeeding the attack (many hypothetical benefits such as double spending and similar but in the case of such ongoing attack no exchange would accept \"finality\" anyway, and the attack is always very apparent as you end up with only half the validators signing blocks...)\n\n    // Local and external difficulty is identical.\n    // Second clause in the if statement reduces the vulnerability to selfish mining.\n    // Please refer to http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ie53/publications/btcProcFC.pdf\n    reorg := externTd.Cmp(localTD) > 0\n    tie := externTd.Cmp(localTD) == 0\n    if tie {\n        externNum, localNum := extern.Number.Uint64(), current.Number.Uint64()\n        if externNum < localNum {\n            reorg = true\n        } else if externNum == localNum {\n            var currentPreserve, externPreserve bool\n            if f.preserve != nil {\n                currentPreserve, externPreserve = f.preserve(current), f.preserve(extern)\n            }\n            reorg = !currentPreserve && (externPreserve || f.rand.Float64() < 0.5)\n        }\n    }\n\nYou also have very clear way to see that an attack is happening (otherwise convergence would happen... so it is easy to see) and when it started and who started it. So manually siding with the \"honest chain\" is quite easy, probably.\n\n\"Slashing\" is pretty straight forward and easy to add as a safeguard even if the \"nothing-at-stake\" problem is exaggerated, but I do think it might be exaggerated. I am also not sure if the model where each block has a \"score\" in proportion to the stake of the person who signs it (assuming some PoS systems work like that) is very good, as they get massively amplified influence (one, higher probability of being selected, and two, more \"points\" for each block they produce also) but maybe most systems do not use that?", "content_size_bytes": 7109}

I am the inventor of Bitpeople (dot) org that was invented between 2015 and 2018 in collaboration with \"bitnation\" (I since distanced myself from \"bitnation\" because their vision is wrong, I can specify how if anyone is interested). It was originally called Virtual Pseudonym Parties or Online Pseudonym Parties, then for a short time Pseudonym Pairs. I also built a people-vote consensus engine a year and a half ago (under my Swedish foundation Panarchy foundation that also develops Bitpeople), and have now spent half a year solving the \"reserved payment attack\" in multiphop payments (this is not under my foundation, it is part of a separate and older project called Resilience as it required such a solution).\n\nThe \"Achilles heal\" in Bitpeople is the man-in-the-middle attack and this has been very openly communicated since 2020-something probably. There are many different ways to solve it (i.e., to establish a secure channel). I have left the problem open over the past 5 years or so, and prioritized things such as\n\nI think one of the most secure might be the \"lock & key\" video chat handshake. It is quite simple. Both people in the pair commit (encrypt and share with the other person) a video plus their public key. At this point, the two people know absolutely nothing about one another, as they are registered with laundered keys that cannot be traced to the previous month's event. They then do the video event, and after, they reveal their committed video + public key.\n\nA bit like a \"hash lock\" but with video. I have considered similar ideas over past 5 years, and wanted to mention it here if anyone is interested.\n\n***On the \"but AI\" issue:*** *1-on-1 video chat is the most secure \"digital Turing test\" there is. Of course, a hypothetical science fiction technological singularity would break it but then such a system could grow a retina more easily or probably build replica androids indistinguishable from people too so at that point most proof-of-unique-human systems collapse anyway - I only mention this science fiction scenario as some people here believe it is already real, and those people typically tend to believe the neuron-transistor analogy, that biology settled for transistors that are 10000x the diameter of our technological ones and that Moore's law somehow did not apply in biology, but I do not think that is a reasonable assumption at all. Rather the transistor is probably protein-scale, like tubulin which is 4.5x8 nm.

After so many years in crypto, I’ve seen the scams, the hype, the empty tokens - and I get why you need to protect the community. Without some kind of filter, the noise would drown everything else out.\n\nThat said, I also believe Ethereum only stays relevant if people actually build on it. And if nobody ever gets to show what they’re building, it gets kind of hard to stay motivated. I’ve seen a few posts recently where people shared something they built (not in a spammy way), and it made me wonder: what’s the actual boundary here?\n\nWe’ve built something we really believe adds value - no token, no “financial incentives”, just a product solving a very real-world problem. Fully onchain, source-available, audited, self-custody - the kind of thing Ethereum was made for.\n\nWe’re not looking to farm attention or sell anything. We’d just love to be able to show the community what’s possible with Ethereum today - and maybe get a bit of feedback too.\n\nSo, my question is: how is Rule 9 applied in practice? Is there any room for honest builders to share what they’ve created, as long as it’s not marketing fluff?\n\nIf not, I’ll fully respect that. Just thought it was worth asking.\n\nThanks for keeping this place clean and thoughtful - I know that’s not easy.\n\n\\- someone who still believes in building", "content_size_bytes": 1499}

The goal is to enhance efficiency and trust in the network.\n\n**What's mechanism?**\n\nEIP-7732 separates block validation into two parts:\n\n* Consensus validation (by proposers)\n* Execution validation (by builders)\n\nBlock validation now happens in two steps: proposers check network rules first, then builders provide and verify the full transaction data.\n\n**Why is this needed?**\n\nToday, most Ethereum validators outsource block construction to third-party builders via a trusted relay. This introduces risks as:\n\n• Trust assumptions.  \n• Higher latency.  \n• Missed attestations.\n\n**How does it work?**\n\nInstead of including a full execution payload, proposers include a signed commitment from a builder.\n\nLater, the builder must reveal the actual payload matching that commitment.\n\nProposers get paid if the builder behaves correctly, even if they don’t trust each other.\n\n**What’s this Payload Timeliness Committee?**\n\nA subset of validators now checks whether builders revealed their promised payloads on time.\n\nThey don’t need to check the payload’s validity, just that the right data showed up when expected.\n\nThis offloads critical work away from attestations.\n\n**Benefits of EIP-7732:**\n\n• Improved security.  \n• Greater efficiency and speed.  \n• Enhanced reliability.  \n• Better scalability.\n\n**Any changes to the Execution Layer?**\n\nNope, this EIP is purely at the consensus level.\n\nThis proposal is a foundational step toward a modular Ethereum and it’s a reflection of network's commitment to long-term reliability and trustlessness.\n\n**If you looking for a reliable way to delegate your ETH**, with proven performance and consistent dependability, **Everstake** is a staking solution you can count on.", "content_size_bytes": 2135}

I didn't ship a dApp. I don't code.  I learned to program in LISP at university, which has given me a phobia of unclosed parentheticals but not much in the way of practical relevance.\n\nFor reasons that I don't think I can adequately explain, I decided that I wanted to take part in a hackathon *anyway*. I figured I'd spend 48 hours writing weird, Ethereum-aligned fiction. I even created KPIs:\n\n* One completed story I was proud of\n* One person telling me that they liked it\n* One moment where I felt like I belonged.\n\nI submitted a Taikai application that made my plan extremely clear. Four days later, I was accepted, along with a flight from ETHPrague and the promise of free food during the build. I took this to mean they understood and approved of my plan.\n\nThis was my first mistake.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k046l94rkt9f1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=51d38dac12e1a068c6cddea6762eac633547df3e\n\nI spent most of the two days and nights surrounded by unnervingly clever young men and women working in intense little teams, competing for €60,000 in bounties. I didn't want a bounty. I just wanted to finish something that I could share; partly for professional pride, mostly because I'd staked 0.05 ETH for a wristband and a place at the table, which would only be returned if I submitted a valid project. \n\n*Valid* was doing a lot of heavy lifting, here.\n\nI wrote directly into a GitHub repository, every thought committed in real-time to prove that the stories were conceived and written during the event. I lived on the (surprisingly good) conference buffet.\n\nI stayed at the venue until midnight the first night and got up again at 4am; my anxiety-driven insomnia finally useful.\n\nI challenged myself to include the Hackathon bounty givers, tagging them on my project notes. No one noticed. Still, I had great fun tucking a story into iExec code templates about a guy writing a heartbroken letter to his ex, passively-aggressively formatted as software. I called it *Breakup as a Service*. I spent a ludicrous amount of time formatting the code to look just right, even though it didn't do anything.\n\nAnother was an intentionally ridiculous letter written by a Hackathon participant who's absolutely certain that cleaning whiteboards and offering positive energy makes them integral to a team that hasn't noticed them.\n\n>To: The Belgrade Judging Committee  \nSubject: Prize Distribution Appeal  \nI am submitting this formal appeal to be retroactively included as a member of Team *Rebase And Chill*. While I was not listed as an official team member, I am assuming that the omission was administrative, not intentional.\n\nIt was very meta. But to complete the hackathon, I didn't just need to submit a project; I needed to present a five-minute pitch of my product. My pitch, I decided, would be to read this story aloud. I've done a lot of readings and I was pretty sure the story would take about four minutes, leaving me one minute to introduce myself and explain what I was doing. If I spoke quickly, I might even get ten seconds on the importance of fiction in tech. But this is shoved into the pile of things to worry about after I've submitted my project.\n\nBy the evening of the second day, the other teams were in tense discussions to get their apps working and filming polished demo videos in odd corners of the Sava Centar.\n\nI created a pretty PDF of five stories that I decided were complete, another word doing some very heavy lifting, and wasted two hours making a pretty cover. At the last minute, I included a page of completely pointless project metrics.\n\n* Stories finished: 5\n* Words written: \\~9,000\n* Useful words extracted: 2,607\n* Existential crises: 2.5\n* Coffee: insufficient\n* Steps (mostly pacing around the Sava Centar): 23,248\n* Meaningful glances from judges: 3 (estimated, unreliable)\n* GitHub commits: 71\n* Commits containing profanity: 3\n* Hackathon backers mentioned: 5/9\n\nThat night, I discovered that the demo video wasn't optional: it was a requirement for getting my stake back. I retreated to my accommodation, sleep-deprived and muttering. After a few hours of fitful rest, I made a loom video of the PDF with a voice-over that sounded like I was slowly disintegrating.\n\nI submitted it with fifteen minutes to spare.\n\nThis was about the time that Taikai crashed, which I'm choosing to believe wasn't personal. It sounded like the conference center was chaos so I stayed in my room. I was supposed to pitch this thing, like a real product. I needed an introductory statement. I needed to rehearse reading the story. I probably should've made PowerPoint slides but there was definitely no time for that. Somehow, I had to explain my art to a crowd who were expecting to check if my code would compile.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cq4yxmn3lt9f1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8818ce118cc7c880c001bca90b5501af4034186a\n\nThe easy first step was to practice my story so that I would know how long it took to read. Before I began, I glanced at the official Discord channel. My heart sank. The pitch sessions would start an hour after submission deadline, it said. I’d already blown half of that on spiraling. Someone posted a spreadsheet with all the teams. I was 7th. I grabbed my stuff and ran to the Sava Centar, arriving at five past.\n\nThe spreadsheet showed team number three as “in the room”, which I took to mean pitching, giving me twenty glorious minutes to grab a pastry and cobble together an intro. But then the status line vanished. I abandoned the coffee queue and marched up to the desk in front of the conference hall to ask how I’d know when it was me.\n\n[Photo by SimonaSerban.eth](https://preview.redd.it/w8uoywb6lt9f1.jpg?width=482&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=29582e2f927da349bae978fa91de390b39d5ae97)\n\nThey scanned the spreadsheet and told me I should just go in and wait  my turn. Right. No pastry. No coffee. No prep. But at least I’d get to  hear other people’s pitches and work out what I was supposedly meant to  be doing.\n\nI walked in to find clusters of people all over the  room. Some were sitting at small tables facing the wall. A small crowd  huddled near the stage; I assumed they were the team currently pitching. Someone tapped me on the shoulder and whispered the format: I had five minutes to speak. She’d wave when my time was up so that we could have three  minutes for the Q&A. I nodded and asked in a whisper where I should  sit. She pointed to a table where two men were engrossed in their  laptops. There wasn’t much room but I sat down across from them, pulling  out my notebook. I settled in. I smiled politely at the two men across  from me. One, a friendly looking man with a thick beard, smiled back.  The other never looked up. I leafed through my scribbled pages and began  rooting around in my pockets for my pen.\n\nAbout ninety seconds passed before the friendly one with the beard looked at me and spoke at full volume, as if we weren’t in a room full of people nervously  pitching their projects.\n\n“So,” he said.\n\n*Rude*, I thought.\n\nA brief pause and he continued. “Do you want to start?”\n\nI blinked and then froze in horror. “Is this my pitch session?”\n\nBoth stared at me and nodded. Yes. Yes, it was.\n\nI  opened my mouth and closed it again, hoping the floor might swallow me  whole. I mumbled something incoherent about fiction before closing my  mouth again firmly. FriendlyBeardGuy asked me if I had a Github repo. I  did! I spelled out t-w-e-l-v-e-m-e-a-t-b-a-l-l-s and they each pulled up my repository on their laptops and began rummaging through my files. That flicker of relief vanished: This was exactly the wrong place to start.\n\nI tried to explain that the repo was full of stories. They looked up from their laptops and then down again.\n\nMr Serious broke the silence. “So you have no code?”\n\nA tiny shake of my head.\n\n“Is there an app?”\n\nAnother tiny shake.\n\nHe  glanced at his screen, as if retracing the steps that had led him here.  He looked like a man who’d arrived at the wrong meeting, the wrong  building, possibly the wrong profession, but was too polite to say “What  the hell is this?”\n\nI stared at the floor as I explained that I was going to read them a story.\n\nHeavy silence, as if I were a cat offering them a dead bird.\n\nI  fumbled for my phone to find the file, which I had not yet actually ever read aloud. I tripped over the title like it was a loose paving  stone. Both men stared at my repo as if a user manual might appear.\n\nI took a deep breath and read the next line, where the story was  addressed to the judging committee. FriendlyBeardGuy looked up, puzzled. Was I talking to him?\n\nAt least he was listening. I kept going, half hoping the floor would reconsider.\n\nAs  I got to the bit about the participant wiping the whiteboard that no  one had used, Mr Serious glitched, his face shifting into something that  might have been a smile. That tiny spark was all I needed. I kept  reading, my confidence growing. The woman from the start walked over,  hovering behind the men. She held out a flat hand, lifting it up and  down. I stopped, stared at her in confusion. She made a wavey motion.\n\nOh *shit.*  I was reading competently, finally, which meant that I was using a public reading voice for an easily-distractable audience. My mother would have called it my outdoor voice;  meanwhile other people were in there doing their own  pitches, probably wondering what the hell was wrong with me. “I’m so, so sorry,” I said. “I didn’t mean to be so loud.”\n\n“No, no,” she said, looking almost as confused as my judges. “Just your five minutes are up.”\n\n*That’s it*?  I looked at her and then at the men. This was the signal for the three-minute Q&A, a nightmare from which I might never recover.  Maybe one of the questions would be “How does the story end?”\n\nFriendlyBeardGuy  smiled at me the way you smile at someone having a psychotic episode  and said, “Don’t worry” in a soothing voice. I took this to mean I  should keep reading. Somehow, I made it to the end of the story. “Thank  you,” I said in a gravelly voice.\n\nBoth of them stared at the middle distance without a word. I could only have made this worse by offering to tell the whole story in interpretive dance. The floor  beneath me remained disappointingly solid.\n\nMr Serious lifted his laptop and turned it towards me, showing me my repo. “I found code,” he said.\n\n*Breakup as a Service*  glowed on the screen. I gritted my teeth and attempted to speak through  them. “It’s a story about a guy who is trying to use code templates to  write software but he’s lying to himself and really just writing to his  ex-girlfriend.”\n\nThis did not help to clear things up.\n\n[Excerpt from Breakup as a Service](https://preview.redd.it/gjmnvjeclt9f1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=38404e4ac88a82e1779a487b449da2565a37a9f5)\n\nHe scrolled through the file. “So, this won’t run?”\n\n“No.”  Right now, this was the only thing that I was confident on. “It’s pure  vibe coding. I wrote it with AI. I showed it to a dev friend to check  the syntax but he refused.”\n\nFriendlyBeardGuy nodded in sympathy with my unknown friend.\n\n”There’s  a PDF,” I said. “Of all the stories. That’s probably easier to read  than the Github repo.” They both nodded pleasantly. They were never  going to read the PDF.\n\n”That was a very enjoyable story to hear,” said FriendlyBeardGuy. We were finished.\n\nI stumbled out and started laughing. Someone turned to stare, but after the last ten minutes, it barely even registered.\n\nIt was over. At least for me.\n\nMr Serious was probably still staring at my code, hoping it would eventually explain itself.\n\nIn that regard, he and I had a lot in common.\n\n\\---\n\nThis one's a bonus article, because I love you.

This was my first Ethereum event, and I wasn’t sure what to expect.  A security guard stood ramrod straight in front of an ETHPrague banner, like the hall needed protecting from unknown hordes. He glanced at my wrist dismissively and pointed at the next building.\n\nThere, things looked a bit more hopeful. A woman stood behind a make-shift counter,  radiating the excitement of a first-time substitute teacher determined not to mess up.\n\n\"Hi,\" I said. \"I'm Twelve Meatballs.\"\n\nShe looked at me. I looked at her.\n\nShe broke first. \"I need your ticket.\"\n\nOf course she did. I pulled out my phone, flustered.\n\n\"Are you--\" She paused, swallowing the word *lost*.  \"...here for ETHPrague?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, poking frantically at my phone.\n\n\"It's a QR code,\" she told me. She was on the verge of explaining to me what a QR code was when I finally found my ticket. She scanned it, relieved that the issue had been so easily resolved. Then, almost as an afterthought, she handed me a paper bag of goodies: plastic battery pack, postcard, and a small bottle of what looked like soy sauce. \"It's an energy drink,\" she told me helpfully.\n\nI slipped into my first session, sitting in the back like I was afraid someone was going to give me detention. \"Prove you are human,\" said the man on the small podium and for a moment, I wasn't sure I could.\n\n(I'll link the talks as I go so you can consider which ones are worth watching.)\n\nThat was [Rémi introducing Self Protocol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFUHuN0g5ls); at that point, I had no idea that I was [going to end up obsessing about their proof of humanity](https://twelvemeatballs.com/coverage/proof-of-humanity/). Next, Mely.eth talked about the shift from domains to usernames and how [ENS can solve the centralization of our online identities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHtROWyI-oo).\n\nThe morning had barely started and already my brain was full.\n\nI slipped out as unobtrusively as I could and returned to the security guard. \"I'm just wondering if there's anywhere here to get coffee.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't know,\" he said. \"But there's this thing called Google Maps.\"\n\nChastened, I turned to walk away. \"Right. Thanks.\"\n\n\"No, wait.\" He pulled out his phone. \"I'm just looking.\" He hadn't been telling me off, just thinking out loud.\n\nI smiled and glanced at his nametag. It said ShieldTech.\n\n\"OK, I found something,\" said ShieldTech. Coffee was available at the opposite side of the market but he didn't like the route Google offered. \"Don't do that. Just go straight this way and turn left. It's called....\" He struggled to translate the name. \"I think Coffee King.\"\n\nI did not need the name of the coffee place and especially not in English. \"Thank you very much,\" I called over my shoulder, escaping back into the hall before he could be any more helpful.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hsfncxj8ba9f1.jpg?width=2618&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=14f3a5e1c07c856f0810c7f3e30fe1e557d37300\n\nIn the main presentation room, [Anthurine Xiang introduced EIP-7907](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzEY0_6EL44) in a fantastically relatable manner, using Uber as an analogy: surely you wouldn't want your driver to pay a flat rate, regardless of the distance of your trip. But at the same time, you wanted to know how much you were likely to pay before you got in the car. I'm not saying I *understood* EIP-7907 but at least I was starting to grasp what was at stake.\n\nUnfortunately, this seemed to mark the limit of my ability to take in new information. I wandered into [mf's talk on the new Cypherpunk generation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqTLKi1mZ40) hoping for something revolutionary. I left mostly thinking about lunch.\n\nI made my way to a coffee stall that may or may not have been called Coffee King. \"Do you speak English?\"\n\nHe rolled his eyes. \"What do you want?\"\n\nI relaxed. This was much more the level of service I expected in Eastern Europe. I ordered a caffé latte, \"just a single shot,\" I told him. I needed to pace myself for the soy sauce drink later. He rolled his eyes and handed me a milky coffee. Fortified, I returned to the conference.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q18xij5aba9f1.jpg?width=2618&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b4fdf494ce6ca747cbdf8deec3a9efc8e5fd87f8\n\nThe highlight of my day was [Tomasz Stańczak's fireside chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUADTUaXoDs&t=6s). Someone behind me was muttering about Layer 2s capturing all of the value and Stańczak responded as if he'd heard the man, explaining that the first focus had to be the growth of the network.  \"This is not the time to imagine that Ethereum has to focus on collecting fees from L2s.\" Instead, he suggested that we want L2s to keep winning and expanding.  Our biggest challenge right now, he said, was the courage to change things and the courage to explore.\n\nIf there was an official Ethereum anthem, I would have been humming it.\n\nAndrew Koller of Kraken's talk [on onboarding users, not just holders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2C92EZ5KK_U) shocked me with the stat that only 20% of users bother to withdraw funds from Kraken; the majority are holders, not users, and he wants to change this.  From there, I accidentally sat in on [Gavin Wood’s talk on Jam and CoreVM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWkytppv8Ns): I understood maybe 3% of it, but the parts I *did* catch were fascinating.\n\nThat was the pattern: sharp edges of clarity inside long stretches of blur. [Mariia Yaatskovska on CoW swaps solver competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzlkHTZHi6M), [DCBuilder on the trust issues of client-side proving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOi-zAXReNE&pp=0gcJCdQJAYcqIYzv) and [Tomas Studenik on what happens if we lose power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7EKLow08Fw) all had good and accessible talks.\n\nI ended the day with [the panel on Ethereum Privacy Roadmap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5iMds9_s90), which became [the first of my articles about the conference](https://twelvemeatballs.com/coverage/ethprague-we-are-larping-at-privacy/).\n\nI have to admit that I was relieved that the content for the day was over. By the end, I didn't even have enough energy to keep saying hello to ShieldTech, who kept staring sternly ahead as if I might be a fatal distraction to his role as our protector. I found a restaurant near my hostel and collapsed into a platter of Schnitzel to consider my thoughts.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7oj0p9beba9f1.jpg?width=3321&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d2bdda49229f07a4b5b9b3084f333806a218a169\n\nI'd  worried that the conference would be too technical, aimed at devs and genius mathematicians and not relevant or even comprehensible to me. And sure, there was technical content but there was also plenty for an outsider like me to engage with. Not just plenty, too much to even keep up with.\n\n\\~o\\~\n\nIt was raining as I arrived for Day Two.  ShieldTech waved me over. \"I have new information,\" he told me. \"If you want coffee, you just go into that hall there. The one marked as...\" He paused, possibly counting in English in his head. \"Seventeen. That is where you should go to get coffee.\" I had the feeling he'd spoken more English today than in the previous three years.\n\n\"No problem,\" he said, and went back to watching people's wrists to make sure they had their wristbands.\n\nI fingered my mystery soy sauce bottle and went straight to the presentation rooms.\n\nSomehow, the day-two schedule was even better than the first.  I started with [Katarzyna Kiwalska's lament](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0slXeRXe-2g) that companies seem to always be waiting for the right moment to start worrying about sustainability.  Dr. Maurice Chiodo amused us with his consulting work on [AI projects seriously lacking in common sense](https://youtu.be/46prZzUxa8Q?si=09zVXk6rqNszD7J7), let alone ethics.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/63lvb2fhba9f1.jpg?width=2795&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d59cfe35225cdaad1ed74b797906d88ed33d4c3c\n\nThe first fireside talk of the day was [Aya Miyaguchi and Christopher Fabian](https://youtu.be/GSQg2yccM_4?si=gFeq921kyBay4f1O) talking about the Ethereum Foundation and working with UNICEF (my favorite anecdote: Aya trying to surreptitiously text Vitalik under the table to say \"I think this guy is serious\"  while Chris thought that maybe she was just really bored of him). This was followed by the headlining fireside chat with Vitalik Buterin and Tim Berners-Lee (ETHPrague have not released this video but you can read my take: [Dreams of Decentralization](https://twelvemeatballs.com/coverage/dreams-of-decentralization/)).\n\nAfter that line-up, I retreated to the open courtyard, where thankfully it had stopped raining. I made the mistake of checking X to see a viral post: \"So is there *anyone* in crypto who's over 30?\" The online discourse seems to constantly reinforce that the crypto-verse is overwhelmingly white, male, and above all young. At ETHPrague, it couldn't have been more off-base. Sure, two baby-faced boys of dubious hygiene sat at the table behind me, arguing about serious hackathon stuff.  But at the same time, a couple in their 60s walked past, talking animatedly, dressed like they'd just stepped out of a Milan showroom. I could hear at least four languages being spoken from a range of men and women\n\nThe space wasn't *just* young and it definitely wasn't just male. Admittedly, the two hackers definitely needed proof of being over 18 but no one questioned their right to be there. Or mine.\n\nAnd honestly, that felt pretty great.\n\nI returned to the fray with a quick smile at ShieldTech, who had gone back to pretending that he'd never seen me before.\n\nI was ready for the next firehose of information. Sara Polak cracked us up between hard facts about [archaeology and how blockchain could make a difference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3Je2snOPVc). Paul Brody injected us with raw hopium as he talked about [enterprise use of stablecoins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NivgjKN1NX0). [Joachim Schwerin from DG GROW of the European Commission](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGwm53kO44A) nailed the need for anonymity, calling out the huge systemic risks in legacy capital systems.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bam9y1fjba9f1.jpg?width=2869&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1bbc907eb9d776bacb88464ffcf6023453c59041\n\nMy biggest challenge wasn't going to be searching for three presentations to write about...but picking *only* three.\n\nThe only downside was that the whole thing felt wildly unmoderated. There were “hosts,” not moderators. No one was managing the time, so talks ran over, questions rambled, and transitions didn’t really exist. In ROOT, I heard one host say “Hey, you don’t have to leave,” as half the room quietly did. The problem was that there was no break to change tracks: if you didn't walk out, you missed the beginning of the next interesting talk or worse, got caught up in an audience member's monologue of \"not a question but more of a comment\".\n\nStill, it was a great day and I was overflowing with ideas and cross connections. And on top of everything else, when I left, ShieldTech almost smiled at me.\n\nI had thousands of words of notes. It took two beers to stop my brain from spinning and a glass of wine to get it spinning in the other direction.\n\n\\~o\\~\n\nSomehow, the third day, I convinced myself that not only could I take in another day of conference presentations but that I could attend *two conferences at once*. This was the final day of ETHPrague but also the only day of ETHGlobal Pragma, situated in another hall about five minutes away.\n\nThis time, I registered at the ETHGlobal tent without any confusion or weird explanations. Although, I also did not receive any mystery soy sauce bottles, so I might need to rethink that approach.\n\nBack at Hall 13, ShieldTech *definitely* smiled at me. Then he saw that I was wearing the wrong wristband.  I said something about the other conference but he just shook his head and looked away. I felt like I'd just been caught cheating.\n\nETHGlobal Pragma felt like a tech conference dressed up for its first job interview: champagne instead of Red Bull, tasteful music, photographers everywhere, waiters bustling through to pick up abandoned plates of canapes. The caffé latte came with meticulous foam art. Hipster devs and first-time hackathon attendees looked equally uneasy as they stood at the cloth-covered tables. Someone nodded hello to me and I spilled my coffee in surprise. It was day three: was I... a veteran?\n\nSome of the same speakers were at ETHGlobal Pragma as at ETHPrague but they were just as good the second time around. Tomasz Stanczak spoke eloquently in more detail about [Ethereum's long-term vision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacHN851czA). [Martin Derka and his cats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYM92J7kgPE) talked about Intelligent Sequencers which sounds dull but definitely wasn't. (My notes just say, \"F\\*ck me, I think I understand Zircuit\" but this may have just been a fever dream.)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d3j7352mba9f1.jpg?width=3308&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1643d20d91dbae1bc589832b3687f1bb9662a5d4\n\nI returned to the ETHPrague halls, putting the relevant armband on the other wrist like I was advertising my poly status. ShieldTech nodded approvingly and let me in.\n\nI had arranged to meet an online friend for lunch, except that I was too hyped up to eat and instead offloaded conference braindumps on the poor man. You know who you are...Sorry, but it did help!  After that much needed debrief, I was wow'd by [Aleksejs Ivashuk's talk on what happens if your government says you don't exist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcFA6EsnTms), which led directly to my [querying Self Protocol's solution](https://twelvemeatballs.com/coverage/proof-of-humanity/).\n\nI wandered back to ETHGlobal Pragma  ~~for more canapes~~  to watch Chris Hobcroft talking about what Ethereum's *for*, but by now, I was struggling to take any new information in or even to stay awake.\n\nI wasn't quite desperate enough to try the soy sauce energy drink but luckily, Paul Brody woke me up again with his engaging talk on why [privacy is critical for business adoption](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacHN851czA&list=PLXzKMXK2aHh7vLS72NelQ2dOx2VgPNxJZ&index=3&pp=iAQB) (although I still don't understand why he is passionately against TEEs).\n\nAnd then, as if in a fever dream, I realized that we were already at the finale. Vitalik's keynote was an  [amazing call to action for DAOs](https://youtu.be/4cwLvbnpWwY?si=Fo7MxwSTzSAfxqVv) to reinvent themselves so they can aim for greatness. He spoke with Kartik Talwar for an hour and fifteen minutes, until the sounds of glasses clinking for the ETHGlobal Happy Hour became overwhelming and they brought the presentation to a close.\n\n[Photograph courtesy of the ETHGlobal Pragma Flickr account](https://preview.redd.it/1mnd15ooba9f1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ea756af39e19a2fc77132ba2974b441afc9a9ed)\n\nI ended up sipping Pils next to a shark-faced man wearing a suit that cost more than my annual income. He introduced himself with a smooth smile, explaining that he was one of the ETHGlobal  sponsors. Was I taking part in the Hackathon?\n\n\"I'm a writer,\" I said, managing somehow *not* to introduce myself as Twelve Meatballs or offer weird personal details that would need serious explaining. As a result, I didn't identify myself at all, too tired and confused to attempt to be witty.  \"I'm writing about the conference.\"\n\n\"That's interesting,\" he said. \"Where can I read your work?\"\n\nI looked at him blankly. The conference was still in progress; how could I have written about it already?\n\nHis smile tightened. \"Like a website?\" He was clearly trying to be kind.  As it happens, I have four (4) websites with various types of writing on them, any one of which I could have told him about. But at that moment, this escaped me. \n\n\"I haven't written it yet,\" I said, as if I'd never written a word in my life.\n\nHe nodded and kept nodding as he moved to the next table, introducing himself with a smooth smile.\n\nI retreated to the halls of ETHPrague, where my friend ShieldTech informed me that the conference was over and everyone was leaving. After an awkward pause, he helpfully informed me that there was a rave that I could go to.\n\nAttending a Czech rave would make for a wildly amusing story but I had already experienced more than my share of failed social interactions for the day. I had at least one Gb of notes and a bottle of soy sauce in my bag that I was apparently doomed to carry around forever. That felt like enough.\n\n\\---\n\nThis completes [my series on ETHPrague](https://twelvemeatballs.com/).

What's compelling is the atomic execution - either the entire strategy succeeds or it reverts. No partial failures across chains. \n\nThey call them 'Supertransactions' which bundle everything into one user signature.This feels more sustainable than current bridging UX.

We spilled along the walls, hovered by the entrance or watched the live stream in the two smaller conference rooms, Flower and Seed.\n\nJosef J, hosting the chat, laughed at the idea of introducing the two headlining guests of the conference. \"We have Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, and Vitalik, the inventor of Ethereum, joining us today.”\n\nHe neatly avoided filling the hour with history lessons and asked the two men to dive directly into the core values of the web and Ethereum, starting with decentralization.\n\nBerners-Lee explained that the Web was designed as decentralized from the start. Researchers had their own Unix computers sitting on their desks, so he figured that everyone who had an internet connection would just download the software and run it. Anyone could have their own website, anyone could run their own web server. His initial vision was clear: We would all be peers, choosing who we wanted to link to.\n\nI've interacted with Berners-Lee once before. I was running a web design team in London and I looked up his bio on CERN. It was clearly cobbled together from multiple sources. Sentences repeated, tense changes, just a mess. It made me sad, so I rewrote the whole thing, taking care to stick to his voice and the original text, just turning it into a single coherent description. I mailed my version to him and he replied the same day, acknowledging the time that I had spent on it and thanking me for my effort. His bio was updated. I spent the next two years telling everyone that I had helped Tim Berners-Lee with his home page.\n\n\"That feeling of empowerment was amazing,\" he said on stage, talking about the web, not what he did for my reputation. \"And we've kind of lost that.\"\n\nButerin talked about Ethereum and its origin story based on multiple ideologies. Yes, there was Bitcoin and smart contracts, but also BitTorrent, shared memory, and, most importantly, that same dream of peer-to-peer networks. Ethereum was not just programmable money but an attempt to reconstruct that feeling of empowerment that Berners-Lee had described.\n\nAnd yet, he conceded, Ethereum has not escaped the centralizing pressures of the web. High fees, Buterin said,  killed consumer applications. What survived were systems built for speculation: financial tools and meme coins, not collaborative infrastructure. Worse, everything on-chain was visible by default. The ideal of sovereign individuals had returned, but stripped of privacy. But, he said, his biggest fear was not that the crypto-equivalent of porn would dominate but that we would take short cuts which would lead us to fall short of our goals, in the same way that the early Internet had.\n\nBerners-Lee admitted that he was not happy about a key short cut he took at the time: using the Domain Name System (DNS) as a core part of his design. This introduced a centralization point that he now regrets integrating. He knew he needed a naming system for the web servers and the global infrastructure was already there and easy to integrate. He wished he could go back, he said, as he had not thought sufficiently about the consequences. Now, he told us, he owned his own ens domain, timbl.eth, saying proudly, \"and it's *me*, it's not my webserver\". He seemed to agree that ENS was a much better solution, explaining how it allowed him to use the same domain across multiple systems, and that he wanted to connect his ENS name to his Solid pods.\n\nThat said, timbl.eth is owned and managed by Mely.eth, the Partnerships Manager at ENS Labs. It was registered the day of the fireside chat.\n\nI looked this up for a reason. For all the CT excitement that Tim Berners-Lee had his own ENS domain, I knew that he was extremely outspoken against blockchain solutions [just a few years ago](https://thenextweb.com/news/web-inventor-tim-berners-lee-screw-web3-my-decentralized-internet-doesnt-need-blockchain), co-opting the term Web3 to describe his own project. \"When you try to build that stuff on the blockchain, it just doesn’t work,\" he said at the time.\n\n[Solid (Social Linked Data)](https://solidproject.org/) is Berners-Lee's effort to help users regain control of their personal data. His goal is to allow users to decide where their data is stored, who can access it and how it can be used. Solid users keep their information in decentralized data stores called \"pods\", essentially secure, personal web servers for data. Applications request permission to access the data in a pod and the users can grant or revoke access at any time. Berners-Lee explained that the project emerged from the Decentralized Information Group (DIG) at MIT. \"Solid is like the web but it's flipped the right way up.\"\n\nButerin was visibly excited about how multiplayer use cases for Solid might work; quickly dismissing \"single player\" as by far the easier one to solve for. \"Like, say you have a document that the three of us are editing. Where would the data live? What servers would we be talking to? What if all of us are constantly reading and writing to it?\" He also asked about social media sites: where would that data live?\n\nRight now, said Berners-Lee, that document would be owned by one person, who would set up access control for the others to be able to edit. Similarly, he envisioned Solid's social media having a federated approach like Mastodon.\n\nButerin acknowledged this, saying it seemed like the equivalent of each person having their own microblog, but with much more efficient wiring. However, it was clear that he was already chewing on the concept. Later, he brought pods up again in the context of trust, pointing out  that Google was much less likely to do something very egregious with personal data than some totally random small pod. He wondered if there was some way to work with cryptographic tools (ZKPs, MPCs, trusted hardware) to make it more possible to trust any pod regardless of who's running it.\n\nIn response to cryptographic tools, Berners-Lee talked about a project at Oxford using MPCs on communally owned intermediate node. He also mentioned that Solid's query language was being used to ask \"zero-knowledge questions\", like whether a person's driving license allows them into a pub without having to reveal the full license information. I wondered if he'd attended the same Self Protocol presentation that I had.\n\nBoth men repeatedly returned to the problem of governance; it wasn't just about code but the coordination around it. Who shapes the roadmap? Who decides what's next?\n\nBerners-Lee said that everyone he talks to is interested in self-governance. \"We are all on Github,\" he said, and so we should be using Github for governance. When you see a group that works really well, ask them how they do their governance. Then clone it, fork its process.\n\nButerin took the idea of decentralized coordination a step further. The internet had grown beyond the reach of any single country—not even the U.S. could now say, definitively, that a blockchain or platform shouldn't exist. At the same time, he stressed, these systems weren’t trying to replace states. “They’re not competing for kilometers of land,” he said. Instead, they were building alternative ways of organizing power. He wants to see collectives being able to negotiate directly with governments on certain state-like functions.\n\nBy now, the fireside chat was feeling like an organic conversation with a rhythm of its own as Berners-Lee and Vitalik bounced off of each other's ideas. During a natural pause, Josef J set them off again by asking about a subject both had expressed an interest in: AI. Could algorithms be better decision makers than humans?\n\nButerin responded first, saying that it depended on the context. He believes that for the foreseeable future, it's not *AI vs Human* but *AI plus Human*. He talked about centaurs in chess, human-AI teams which were better than pure humans and pure AI for twenty years (1996-2017) before pure AI became strong enough to play alone. He sees significant value in AI for preference expression, where AI helps to create a compressed version of your preferences. He revisited this idea two days later, in his [ETHGlobal Pragma keynote with Kartik Talwar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cwLvbnpWwY), when he talked about how AI could better reflect very specific personal preferences over the presumed general preferences of a reasonable person.\n\nHis concern, he said now, was the scope and nature of AI's decision making authority, quipping that his vision was *not* \"hey, let's have ChatGPT run the Czech Republic\". AI should be a player in the game, rather than AI *being* the game.\n\nBerners-Lee’s response reframed the scenario: AI could work as a personal assistant with access to an individual's personal data. So for example, the user shares their Strava and Fitbit data with the AI. The AI uses that data to offer highly personalised suggestions to the user, recommending specific shoes for training and maybe different shoes for a half-marathon race. He was openly curious about how trust and delegation might work if an AI represented you, noting that his company, Inrupt, is already talking to VISA about how AI could have permission to make purchases on a user's behalf.  This seems to be a reference to Inrupt's [agentic wallets](https://securityboulevard.com/2025/05/privacy-for-agentic-ai/); [Visa's CEO spoke about the partnership at KWAAI in March](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWnqeJMxN8&t=3s).\n\nThe final question was whether they saw current technology as leading towards a surveillance dystopia or a tech-powered utopia. Buterin countered that the answer is weirder than a simple binary choice. There's a powerful and scary trend towards increased surveillance but, at the same time, he's seeing more recognition that digital privacy is important, giving as examples the adoption of encrypted messaging platform Signal and the default use of HTTPS.  He also referred to security benefits of applications moving to browsers, a \"very nice backdoor victory for sandboxing\". He believes that the interplay between technology development, legal norms and social norms is critical in the fight for privacy.\n\nBerners-Lee agreed, emphasizing that the battle between surveillance and privacy was a constant fight which has persisted throughout his experience and will continue. This is a fundamental issue of human rights, he said, and people needed to actively protest and advocate for those rights, including the right to private communication and data storage. If you spend 90% of your time coding and using these systems, he said,  you should spend 5-10% of your time in the street with a placard protesting government surveillance, because this constant battle for rights is not going to stop any time soon.\n\nIt was a strong point to finish on. The room held its breath and then let it go, breaking into loud applause.\n\nWatching the man who created the web sitting next to the man who made Ethereum was fascinating. They talked about decentralisation as a challenge to be solved, each imagining a system that would outlast the chaos they helped unleash. One spoke like a man who remembered a time when the internet was small enough to hold in your hands. The other spoke like someone who had never known a time it wasn’t slipping through our fingers.\n\nThey may not have the solutions. But for that moment, it seemed like it was possible to find a solution, if we cared enough to try. That, for me, underscored the real power of the fireside talk; that we got the chance to hear two people who could rest on legacy, but chose to show up anyway.\n\n\\---\n\n(This is the third of a [series of articles on ETHPrague](https://twelvemeatballs.com/tag/ethprague/) commissioned through a grant from EVMavericks)", "content_size_bytes": 11957}

During that same time, I've been building!\n\nWhy?\n\nFirst off, I love Ethereum. I originally got into Ethereum in 2016 and loved it so much I found a job and worked for a company called BlockApps in 2017 for a few years.\n\nDuring all these years, I've personally onboarded many friends and family to Ethereum, and due to this and my moderation, I've seen every onboarding and UX complaint in the book. And so I decided to take matters into my own hands and build a solution.\n\nWithout further ado, I present to you: [Pistachio](https://pistachio.fi).\n\nWhat originally started out as a better smart wallet has become an onchain neobank. A mobile-first platform to make crypto feel like a modern checking account.\n\nWe offer [elite security](https://x.com/PistachioFi/status/1923120976021115208), think hardware wallet-grade protection built into your phone, with encrypted key storage, biometric + MFA recovery, and compliance powered by Circle. Every user will receive (not live) a virtual ACH, IBAN, and SPEI account for fiat on/off ramps through Bridge (Stripe). Pistachio is also the premier mobile wallet for Plume’s RWA network (coming soon).\n\nWe onboard the user directly to smart accounts provided by Pimlico and ZeroDev. We use the Pimlico paymaster to provide gas abstraction on key user interactions (free in-network P2P transactions, as well as deposits and withdrawals to the yield vaults we provide; only on L2s though, can't really afford to pay any L1 gas fees for you). We have integrated with [LI.FI](http://LI.FI) to provide quality cross-chain swaps. We also use them for zaps, to directly deposit any token from any chain to our earning vaults. All without token approvals and gas as we leverage 4337 (Why not 7702? It was only released recently and we decided to build our product around released tech).\n\nSoon we will have debit cards and auto-rebalancing portfolios (powered by Glider.fi).\n\nThe future vision is to further abstract chains entirely and have a unified balance across all supported L1/L2 networks. Meaning you can receive direct fiat deposits using our Bridge integration (\\~40 bps fee) and immediately have funds liquid for deployment across the entire EVM.\n\nWe’re live in production with 600+ users, $30K in TVL, a 93% retention rate, and over 70% onboarding conversion. iOS is live; Android is coming soon.\n\nI announced our [go-live on X last week](https://x.com/PistachioFi/status/1932834171954909412) to a warm reception! \n\n94K impressions, 528 likes, 514 link clicks. That day we generated over 130 new accounts.\n\nIt's been a long journey to get here. We are a 2 man unfunded (mostly bootstrapped with some light angel funding) team, and we recently just onboarded our third employee (senior web3/RN engineer, former CTO for a YC company). We're scrappy, we ship fast, and we listen to user feedback to fix what's broken and move in a direction to make an application that people will actually want to use.\n\nThis Friday (tomorrow) I will be jumping on the EVM Mavericks podcast with our own u/jtnichol to talk shop and future vision. I encourage all to attend!\n\nAnd now, my humble ask -- If you have an iPhone I would greatly appreciate it if you [download Pistachio](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pistachio-fi/id6466344878) and check out our onboarding and earning vaults! Even better if you're willing to leave us a review / feedback. As it goes, some stuff is broken and we can't test every edge case (there are so many of them because of our gas logic).\n\nThe current goal is to increase MAU and TVL to better improve our leverage for a small seed raise to scale this thing.\n\nI appreciate your attention if you've read up to this point. We're dedicated to improving the UX of the Ethereum ecosystem to better onboard the masses.\n\nThanks,\n\nBrian", "content_size_bytes": 3922}

It sounded reasonable, which is always the first warning sign. We could, Rémi told us, prove that we were human without telling anyone who we are.\n\nOn the surface, their product, Self Protocol, offers a smart, privacy-focused solution to identity in an age of AI hot takes, bots and Sybils. I was fascinated by the idea of a self-sovereign identity layer which would offer a massive increase in personal privacy. It all sounded very sensible, in the way that IKEA instructions sound sensible until you try to assemble the thing and end up crying on the floor.\n\nSelf Labs acquired OpenPassport to tackle the need for Sybil resistance and user verification. Self Pass and Self Connect form the core of a system that lets users prove discrete facts about themselves without disclosing full personal data.\n\nI might be in over my head here, and Rémi talks pretty fast, but here’s what I managed to piece together, hopefully in the right order.\n\nSelf Protocol uses Merkle trees and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) to allow users to prove facts about themselves without revealing their full passport. Merkle trees are data structures used to store and validate data in small chunks, making verification straightforward. Zero-knowledge proofs are protocols that allow someone to demonstrate knowledge of a fact without revealing the underlying information. Together, they let you verify that something is true, without irrelevant detail.\n\nThe problem: If you want to prove your age or nationality online, you usually have to upload a full scan of your passport and hope no one misuses it.\n\nSelf Protocol‘s solution is to generate zero-knowledge proofs based on passport data. Rather than uploading documents or disclosing raw details to everyone who asks, users can locally verify their passport signature using electronic passport NFC technology.  Country-level Signing Certificate Authorities (CSCAs) are published on-chain in a Merkle tree, sourced from the official ICAO registry. Once verified, users can generate a zero-knowledge proof attesting that they own a valid state-issued passport, without exposing anything else about themselves.\n\nThe result is that you can generate a new proof when you need to share personal information to meet a regulatory requirement. Instead of handing over your passport, you reveal only the specific detail that's needed, for example your citizenship status or country of residence, without having to reveal your name, birthdate or passport number.\n\nThere’s a bunch more privacy wizardry involving deterministic nullifiers and entropy that I’ve glossed over but the point is that you're in control of your own data. You choose what to prove and what stays sealed in the envelope.\n\nI love the concept. It has never made sense to me that the teenager at the gas station gets my full name and details just because I want to buy a bottle of beer. With Self Protocol, only the relevant information is shared, that I am over 18, for example, or that I am *not* from a sanctioned jurisdiction. The virtual version of the guy at the gas station never needs to know my name or how old I am.\n\nSo far, so good.\n\nRémi told us about some of the problems they encountered. One recurring headache was that different countries use different cryptographic signature schemes and hash functions on their passports. In theory, all e-passports follow the ICAO standard, but in reality, not so much. Another challenge was supporting users in emerging markets with low-end devices and spotty internet.\n\nAll of which was interesting...but I started to feel uneasy about Rémi’s description of Self Protocol as offering *proof of humanity*. Certainly, we need ways to tell whether we are dealing with a real person or a bot, or whether an opinion flooding a forum is from a crowd of individuals or one person spinning up a hundred fake identities. But is my passport really what makes me human?\n\nI was also unconvinced by Self Protocols application as an anti-Sybil measure, stopping people from creating multiple identities for nefarious reasons. I have two passports. My daughter has three. During the break, I asked another attendee how many passports he had: two. In an era of globalization, multiple passports is becoming increasingly common.\n\nNow, if you are trying to cut off the guy who spins up 147 wallets for an airdrop, sure, it’s an improvement. But a passport isn’t actually representative of a single soul but of citizenship. A person might have two or three but it's still just one of them in there.\n\nThe truth is, I didn’t dwell on it for long, as their assumption worked in my favor. I dropped a note to my daughter to let her know she was a Sybil and went to the next talk.\n\nMy doubts didn’t really come into focus until the last day of the conference, when I attended a session by  Aleksejs Ivashuk from the Apartride Network. Born in Riga during the era of the Latvian SSR, Aleksejs is one of 700,000 individuals who were denied Latvian citizenship following the country’s independence in 1991. He is stateless.\n\nAleksejs made it clear that statelessness is not a marginal issue; he told us that they estimate as many as one billion people are stateless. If the state does not recognize you, you do not have a legal identity. The result is that you don’t have human rights, because, in the eyes of the law, you do not exist. Banks will refuse to make you an account if you can’t prove your nationality or show state-issued identification. Aleksejs shared a direct quote from a bank even after Apartride intervened on behalf of a stateless person: “We know it is against the law but it is our policy”.\n\nTheoretically, crypto could offer a solution for these people: they can be their own bank. However, decentralization is key.\n\nYou have zero percent ownership of your state-issued identification. If you don’t trust the state, Aleksejs told us, then you need to retain ownership of your identity. What we need is stubborn dedication to decentralized systems.\n\nThat uneasy feeling abruptly came into focus. Self Protocol claim to be a decentralized system, even though they are utterly reliant on state-issued passports.\n\nThere was another Self Protocol talk on the ETHGlobal Pragma agenda, happening in parallel with the final day of ETHPrague. I hadn’t planned to attend. But now I had questions.\n\nAfter lunch, I went to “Shipping zkPassport: Bringing Self Protocol to Production” by Marek Olszewski, a co-founder of Celo.\n\nMuch of the material covered the same ground but this time, I caught the contradiction. Passports are decentralized, Marek told us, because they are issued by many different countries.\n\nThis is *wild*.\n\nThe fact that each country issues its own form of state identification doesn't make it decentralized. You can’t self-issue. You can’t opt out. You can’t simply decide, “Oh, I don’t like being American, I think I’ll be German!”\n\nRecently, many of my American friends have asked how to get a European passport, citing a great-grandfather from France or simply a desire to live and work somewhere else. But for most people, the passport that you are born with is the one you are stuck with...unless you are willing to spend years in residency and effort before you qualify even to attempt an application, and even then, this may require you to relinquish your original.\n\nYour government-issued ID is the very definition of a centralized system. As Aleksejs showed us, if your government decides that you do not qualify, you have no recourse.\n\nAnd Marek *knows* this, because he then repeated Rémi’s “anti-Sybil” claim. Self Protocol protected against Sybils, he told us, because it is difficult to get multiple passports.\n\nAfter the first session, I tweeted a photo of Rémi along with a description of the talk. Self Protocol’s X account retweeted it almost immediately. After Marek’s presentation, I tweeted again, this time asking if anyone from Self had attended Aleksejs Ivashuk’s session about the billion stateless people who would be left behind by apps like Self Protocol.\n\n>You refer to passports as a decentralized system but Apartide’s point is that it is actually massively centralised: if my country revokes my citizenship, I can’t just pick another one.\n\nAs of now, two weeks later, I have had no reply. The people most harmed by identity failures remain invisible in the very systems claiming to solve them.\n\nSelf Protocol is doing something valuable: protecting privacy and nudging the identity stack in a better direction. It’s a government-approved identity in a zero-knowledge wrapper. That’s still useful.\n\nYou get privacy. You get plausible deniability. You are likely limited to one or two instances rather than how many wallets you can be bothered to create.\n\nIn a world full of bots, sockpuppets and synthetic opinions, we want to know who’s real. Whether it’s airdrops, governance or public discourse, Sybil resistance is a real issue.\n\nBut Self Protocol has chosen to anchor that resistance in one of the most centralized systems we have: government-issued identity. A passport doesn’t prove you are human. It proves that an ICAO-approved bureaucracy somewhere has decided to acknowledge you.\n\nThat’s the disconnect. Self Protocol borrows the language of self-sovereignty but not the principle.  It offers control over data but not control over inclusion. It's easy to talk about proof of humanity when you’re holding the right documents.\n\nIf we are serious about building decentralized identity systems that are verifiable, portable, privacy-preserving and genuinely inclusive, then we have to confront the reality that not everyone starts from the same place. Do we really want to claim that government recognition defines who we are, or *if* we are?\n\nThe question isn’t just about proof of humanity. It’s how much of our humanity we are willing to outsource and what we lose by trusting governments to decide who counts.\n\n\\---\n\n(This is the second of a [series of articles on ETHPrague](https://twelvemeatballs.com/tag/ethprague/) commissioned through a grant from EVMavericks)", "content_size_bytes": 10337}

Today, over 1 million validators help secure the network by locking up ETH, a living testament to decentralized trust.\n\n**3/ As we look toward the next upgrade, Fusaka, and beyond - one thing is clear:**\n\nEthereum didn’t slow down, it found its rhythm.Where were you during The Merge?And what do you want to see in the next 1000 days of Ethereum?\n\nLet’s hear your vision in the comments below.", "content_size_bytes": 1278}

To avoid a non-attacker getting stuck with the whole payment as penalty, the penalty can be done in \"chunks \". But when penalty is done in chunks, the combined time until the payment has fully timed out tends to increase, and this makes the phase with no penalty vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. The solution is to combine both 2-phase commits, and use the one with the penalty on the first phase as the first phase, and the one with the penalty on the second phase as the second phase. This requires an intermediary phase that shifts from finish-on-timeout to cancel-on-timeout. This is the logical way to do \"payment channels\", and people will notice this eventually.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vrffejdbzh6f1.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=32cf8df9632cf458cd31f888b93c1a66044171b8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wwkwq53czh6f1.png?width=1013&format=png&auto=webp&s=f96072a6846c21e25e61be7680a85f0b7ccf93e6\n\n**Update:**  \n\"Cancel\" in \"finish-on-timeout\" or the 3-phase commit is issued by the sender (not by intermediaries or recipient) and has to be authenticated by the sender to avoid an intermediary lying about it (and thus receiving the payment via the finish-on-timeout). This is analogous to how \"Commit\" is from the recipient (not from intermediaries or sender) and has to be authenticated as well, to avoid an intermediary lying about it (and thus receiving the payment).\n\nThe 3-phase commit deters DoS attacks in all scenarios except when the person paying penalty and the person receiving it are the same person. This scenario is easily deterred by adding fee on top of the payment, paid out in proportion to how long payment was stuck. This is separate from the 3-phase commit though (and the 2-phase commits also has this problem, but, they rely on short timeout which means this problem never becomes a problem).\n\nThis is all very simple. I already implemented it for a backed-by-trust multihop payment system (Ryan Fuggers Ripple) and building Lightning Network, Raiden, Interledger, or whatever else on the 3-phase commit, is simple. The hard part, it seems, is noticing the 3-phase commit. As it seems no one ever noticed it before, at least it was never popularized as everyone seems to try and make either of the 2-phase commits work despite the obvious problems...", "content_size_bytes": 2525}

And no one really wants to fix it.\n\nThe panel is now on YouTube for you to watch in full: [Ethereum Privacy Roadmap](https://youtu.be/b5iMds9_s90?feature=shared)\n\nIn April, Vitalik laid out a [nine-step roadmap](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-maximally-simple-l1-privacy-roadmap/23459) for an ecosystem where privacy is the default. On paper, the path forward looks clear, although Vitalik conceded that it required what he called “significant convenience sacrifices”.\n\nBut at ETHPrague, the panelists painted a damning picture of our potential for privacy-by-default for Ethereum and Web3: technically capable and culturally underprepared.\n\nThe panel kicked off with Mikola Siusko, whose Web3Privacy Now project aims to build a robust privacy culture in the blockchain industry, asking every panelist to start with an honest assessment:  “What’s the state of so-called Web3 privacy? How would you measure the temperature of where we are?”\n\nEmil Bays, a core contributor to the privacy-focused protocol Railgun, neatly sidestepped the question, instead talking about Railgun (“not the perfect system but the system that works today”), proudly commenting that it had been shilled by Vitalik.\n\nSerinko serves as developer relations for the Nym core team, focused on integrating advanced privacy infrastructure to the Ethereum ecosystem. He tried to be positive but ended up on a disheartened, “I’m not sure if I’m that bullish, you know?”  He pointed out that Ethereum and the Internet were not designed to offer privacy by default but he hopes that we are experiencing a slow culture shift. “It’s not impossible to be private,” was as positive as he could get.\n\nMario is a researcher and advocate at Ethereum Foundation, representing EF protocol support, so his critiques come from inside the house. He agreed that transparency could only take us so far and complained that we *talk* about privacy but we don’t exercise it. “It’s sort of LARPing, it’s sort of signalling.” Projects focus on the right keywords or a narrow focus while completely missing the point. And users are using iPhone or Google where there’s no privacy on the base layer.\n\nLasha has been working on blockchain identity solutions since Ukraine’s early government initiatives. He  talked about the difference between security-conscious and the wider world, especially under the onslaught of AI, and concluded that we’re fucked. Outside of the crypto cocoon, we are fighting a losing battle and the hyper-convenience of AI will make it worse. Previously, people spread their digital footprint across different services, whereas now it is trending towards a single interface.\n\nThey all agreed that Ethereum’s radical transparency is great for trustlessness but bad for privacy. The tools we’ve built are flawed: they don’t work well or don’t scale or no one wants to use them. Everyone’s saying the right words and building the right-sounding projects but, as Mario repeated, much of the discussion is just performance and signaling. (He also had a bit of a rant about the community co-opting terms, from Ethereum devs calling themselves hackers to everything being described as cypherpunk).\n\nThe overall fear is that while we are playing at privacy, the real threats are getting worse. Your encrypted transaction means little if your IP, your phone number and your browser fingerprint are broadcasting your identity every time you use the app. The biggest hurdle is getting people to believe in and use the tools, even when they are less convenient.\n\nA few years ago, I had a contract writing fiction for a European defence agency and this reminded me of an issue they had with field radios. The military wanted these to be 100% secure when used by personnel behind enemy lines, to ensure no tactical information would leak: not just the transmission but the location of the teams and that communication was even happening. But out on the field, soldiers found the radios too unwieldy. It was time-consuming to stop and set up and log in, so instead, they used their phones, connecting to enemy cells and sharing classified intel on an unsecured network.\n\nThat’s the problem in a nutshell. Privacy is complex. To be effective, it needs to be end-to-end.  People say they care about privacy until it becomes inconvenient.\n\nPrivacy is political. No one wants to rebuild the stack: the network, technical and cultural layers required to achieve effective, end-to-end privacy.\n\nInstead, here we are, trying to short-cut the issue by bolting a ZK proof onto a surveillance internet. Vitalik’s roadmap assumes that technical solutions drive adoptions. If we get privacy tools into wallets, people will use them. The panel is saying that’s backwards.\n\nEven Emil, the optimist of the group, agreed, acknowledging that from a development perspective, it’s not very easy to integrate Railgun.  You don’t care about privacy until you do, he said, and by then it’s already too late. The average user balks at using a more expensive, less convenient system, even if it’s more private.\n\nWhen I described the panel as fascinating but depressing, I was reacting to the fact that the panelists are at the forefront of protecting privacy and they sound *exhausted*. And not because the problem is too complex (acknowledging that it *is* complex) but because the incentives are all wrong.\n\nMainstream culture needs time to catch up. But we need to integrate more protections *now*, before the surveillance infrastructure becomes irreversible. What I understood from all this: building a private-by-default Ethereum will take more than clever tools; it will take clarity, urgency and conviction.\n\nBecause privacy isn’t just about encryption. It’s about resistance. And most users aren’t looking for resistance. They’re just looking for an easier login.\n\n\\---  \n\n(This is one of a series of articles on ETHPrague commissioned through a grant from EV Mavericks)", "content_size_bytes": 6576}

The core idea is this: what if individuals could speculate on public trust? Instead of just focusing on stock prices or revenue predictions, we could delve into the actual sentiment and perception towards organizations—whether it’s a public entity like Tesla or a private firm like OpenAI.\n\nThe framework consists of two components. The first is a sentiment token, which would be a tradable ERC-20 asset reflecting the level of trust in a specific institution. The second is what I’m referring to as the Public Trust Index (PTI), a score ranging from 0 to 850 that updates based on community votes. Everyone could vote irrespective of token holdings, but those who do hold tokens would have their votes weighted more heavily.\n\nThe goal here is to create a decentralized, real-time mechanism for tracking public sentiment and allowing individuals to express that sentiment through capital. Just like one might go long or short on Tesla stock based on earnings reports or news events, this system would enable trading sentiment tokens in response to events, controversies, or shifts in public perception.\n\nThe significance of this idea, to me, lies in the widening gap between market movements and actual public sentiment. Companies can post stellar financial results and still lose public favor, or they can be adored by users yet face scrutiny from regulators or investors. Unfortunately, this reality isn't transparently captured in today’s systems. This concept aims to bridge that divide, not by establishing a truth oracle, but by creating what I like to think of as a trust oracle. Perhaps that's a more truthful reflection of reality.\n\nThis approach won’t utilize price oracles, nor will it require KYC processes. It would operate around the clock. My intention is to create something streamlined and expressive—a protocol layer that treats sentiment itself as an asset.\n\nNonetheless, I still have some questions. Would people genuinely engage with something like this, or is it merely an appealing idea on paper? What strategies could prevent influential entities from skewing the PTI votes? Should users expect rewards simply for holding sentiment tokens, or is speculation sufficient? Are there existing protocols I should examine to refine the design?\n\nI’m not a developer yet, but I'm in the learning process. If this concept triggers any thoughts—positive or negative—please share. I’m eager to sharpen my ideas and work towards building something impactful.", "content_size_bytes": 2619}

At some point, P2 gains the ability to use transaction T2 and, later, P1 gains the ability to use transaction T1.  In my system, when P2 can use T2, they are supposed to and T1 only exists as an escape if P2 vanishes. \n\nBut it is possible for P1 to release T1 then P2 to almost simultaneously release T2.  These transactions are from the same account (from the same private key) and are mutually exclusive. \n\nAt this point, the system is fine as long as P1 can reliably see T2 in the in the mempool or some other location on the network.  If P1 can see T2, they can extract a secret from it and use it to their advantage elsewhere in my system, which (to P1) acts as compensation for not being able to execute T1.\n\nBut this all hinges on P1 being able to see T2 whether or not T2 ever actually appears on the blockchain.  If P2 knows they only have a chance to get T2, but they always get the punishment associated with the release of their secret, it no longer makes sense for a malicious P2 to release T2 simultaneously with P1 releasing T1.\n\nWhen I designed my system, I assumed that node mempools on pretty much all blockchains contained a list of received transactions that are valid given the current state of the blockchain, and I assumed my P1 could query some nodes to see of T2 was maliciously released and get the secret.  But I recently learned that there are blockchains where this is not the case, and nodes discard any incoming transactions that contradict with a transaction in their mempool, making it probable that P1 would not detect T2.\n\nCan an Ethereum user reliably find two simultaneously released transactions that are contradictory?  Or, alternatively, do nodes propagate valid transactions that contradict with a transaction in their mempool?", "content_size_bytes": 1814}

If quantum computing is an actual threat to bitcoin, then it could produce a black swan event. It will get fixed, but the question then becomes \"How much damage would be done?\"                  \n\nThe proposal Lopp floats is as follows: Some wallet addresses (known as P2PK) will become quantum-vulnerable. These are first-generation bitcoin wallet addresses, including Satoshi's that all begin with \"04.\" The proposal is to exclude these from sending transactions in the future by implementing a soft fork now. In this scenario, satoshi's coins are safe, but -here's the problem- anyone who may be storing their bitcoin on such legacy addresses are also excluded from conducting transactions on the bitcoin blockchain.               \n\nHe goes over the moral and ethical perspective as well: \"Should a quantum-supreme-entity be able to steal Satoshi's coins even if they have the intention to send them to a burner wallet address?\" **Please note I am paraphrasing and encourage you to read his blog.** What about the guy who lost $600 million USD of bitcoin in that landfill? Is it ethical to recover his bitcoin via quantum computing?                   \n\nUltimately, I am glad to see that there is **something** of a proposal to fix the problem before it starts, but this binary fix sounds like it will inevitably harm some participants in the bitcoin ecosystem.                 \n\nDiscuss!                \n\nEDIT: For those of you who don't know, there are generally four different types of wallet addresses. Addreses that begin with 04 are \"quantum vulnerable\" and so too are P2TR. However, my (perhaps flawed, perhaps wrong) understanding is that a soft-fork later will make P2TR wallet addresses quantum-proof later down the road. Jameson Lopp proposes a completely different soft fork that excludes addresses that start with 04 from participating in transactions. So, in summary, two soft-forks would make bitcoin quantum-proof. **The following is a table to help you determine whether or not your bitcoin wallet is quantum proof.:** https://imgur.com/a/d70kiuB", "content_size_bytes": 2502}

The main benefits to owning one are simplifying crypto transactions by replacing wallet addresses with the domain name and easily creating and hosting websites on web3.*\n\nIf you haven’t heard yet, web3 domains are the newest kids on the block(chain) and they have the power to change what we know of as the internet today. But before we dive into all that goodness, let’s take a step back to run through what traditional domains are and define NFTs — that way, you can truly understand the superpowers behind web3 domains.\n\nTypically, you interact with a traditional domain when you type the address (like Twitter.com) into your browser. But did you know traditional domains were originally built to do so much more on the internet? Think of functionalities like email and payments. Hard to believe, right?\n\nBut as we can see, traditional domains haven’t progressed much beyond displaying websites. This might be because traditional domains have been controlled by centralized servers since the internet was created. This made it much more difficult for developers to innovate on top of that technology.\n\nLuckily for us, the tech that powers web3 domains (a.k.a. blockchains) opens up a whole new realm of possibilities for us on the web!\n\n***Okay, so how does blockchain technology make these web3 domains so special?***\n\nGreat question! web3 domains are essentially a suite of smart contracts, which is a fancy term to describe software written on a public blockchain. This means that instead of one company controlling your data online, the power is transferred back to you as the user. And by being built on blockchains, anyone can look at the data stored there, creating a level of ultimate openness and transparency. \n\nOn top of that, there is the benefit of enhanced security — only you hold the power to make updates to your web3 domain, which minimizes worries about servers getting hacked or domains getting stolen.\n\nAll that to say, blockchain superpowers give everyone a safer way to surf the internet while also giving control back to you over what gets shared and where it gets shared.\n\n***Cool, I’m starting to get the power of blockchain but am still not 100% sure what I can DO with a web3 domain?***\n\nWe were just about to get to that! To quickly summarize, here are your domain’s superpowers (with more exciting new features on the way):\n\n1. Simplify crypto transactions by replacing all your complicated wallet addresses with your domain name as your username.\n2. Use your domain to receive 275+ coins and tokens across multiple blockchain networks. \n3. Login to apps with your domain name as your universal web3 username.\n4. Unlike traditional domains, fully own and control your domain. You buy it once, you own it for life!\n5. Easily create and host websites, ranging from personal websites to NFT galleries. ", "content_size_bytes": 2970}

You can check out our leadership team here:[ https://www.definitymarkets.com/leadership](https://www.definitymarkets.com/leadership)\n\nWe’ve spent most of our careers in foreign exchange, working at major banks like Barclays and Lloyds, helping institutions move hundreds of billions through some of the most tightly regulated markets in the world.\n\nAnd we’ve learned exactly what institutions need:\n\n**Security. Compliance. Separation of risk.**\n\nWhen crypto started to mature, we saw what was coming: \\*\\*Institutional capital was on the way.\\*\\*But it wasn’t going to flow through hype or tokens. And no, banks weren’t going to use MetaMask.\n\nThey were going to need infrastructure that looked like what they already trust:\n\n**Regulated. Secure. Transparent.**\n\nSo we got to work.\n\nWe spent years doing the regulatory groundwork, the hard stuff most avoid and turned it into our moat. We built DeFinity as a **non-custodial platform from day one**.\n\nWhy? Because institutions don’t want their trading venue holding their assets.\n\n**Anyone remember FTX?** They need separation of function, risk controls, and audit trails.\n\nWe integrated with Fireblocks (who are like MetaMask for institutions)  which provides secure wallet infrastructure for institutions and made onboarding possible in under four hours.\n\nWe’re not another token without utility. We’re not a DeFi experiment hoping for traction.We’re not waiting for regulators to catch up.\n\n✅ We’re serving clients\n\n✅ We’re generating revenue\n\n✅ We’re regulated, integrated, and live\n\nThis isn’t a vision.

You can't re-create the almost decade long distribution of the old PoW coins (Zcash, Monero, Litecoin). It's impressive that Zcash continues to push out the best privacy tech in the space.\n\n---\n\n📄 [Original Article](https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/06/04/crypto-without-privacy-isnt-crypto)\n\n> Privacy is the soul of crypto, and without it, nothing else we’re doing really matters.\n> If you care about financial sovereignty, you need privacy. If you care about coordinating with others to effect social change, or thinking freely, or building a more prosperous society, you need the free exchange of value. Freedom begins with privacy.\n>\n> As engineers and scientists working on Zcash, we have spent years developing private financial tools that will be embedded into the future of civilization. It is no exaggeration to say that our descendants will either live in a world that rests upon the foundations that we are building today, or else live in a world that we neglected.\n>\n> Zcash was the first cryptocurrency to ship real, strong privacy with zero-knowledge proofs. Solving the privacy problem with cryptography was only the first step: we needed to quickly iterate and improve our cryptography so that it was practical to run on phones, and invest heavily into research that would make it possible to scale. Today, our innovations sit at the heart of many decentralized protocols.\n>\n> But while the path forward for scaling private on-chain payments is now straightforward, no project has addressed the fundamental challenge of scaling private wallets at the same time.\n>\n> Most users of cryptocurrencies will use wallet software that relies on a remote server to enable sending and receiving payments. This helps address scaling problems by pushing bandwidth and computational burdens away from users’ devices, but comes at the cost of requiring the user to relinquish their privacy to remote services.\n>\n> To make our privacy-preserving monetary project a reality we need a user experience that is just as convenient as one that has no privacy at all.\n>\n> The simplest solution is to use exotic cryptography to enable remote servers to assist our local wallet software without revealing any private information. We’ve known that this is theoretically possible, but until recently it seemed to be impractical at scale — at least a decade of new science away, or so we thought.\n>\n> Enter Project Tachyon. With existing cryptography and some clever protocol adjustments, it is completely practical for Zcash’s wallet software to synchronize with a highly active blockchain full of transactions by outsourcing the expensive parts to untrusted third-party servers. The servers don’t learn anything about your wallet and cannot even tell which on-chain transactions correspond with their users.\n>\n> To be sure, the cryptography needed to make this possible and scalable is still not simple. Fortunately, Zcash has a long track record of building and shipping this exact kind of advanced cryptography. We’ve already set the stage for it in some of our recent upgrades, and with Project Tachyon we plan to make rapid progress deploying the remaining changes over the next year.\n>\n> I’m excited that we have such strong enthusiasm and alignment in the Zcash community to make it a reality. But I’m also relieved that we can meet the moment and actually build highly scalable, unstoppable digital money. We don’t have time to wait for any more research or scientific advances. Fortunately, with Tachyon, we can build and deliver today.", "content_size_bytes": 3675}

Total blockchain activity hit a new record. Over 342 million transactions happened in just seven days. That’s the highest weekly number I’ve come across so far.  \n  \nSolana, BNB Chain, and Tron led the activity. Solana especially stood out. It alone handled almost 60 percent of all transactions. That spike didn’t just happen out of nowhere. A lot of it came from meme coins launching non-stop on Solana platforms like LetsBonk and Pumpfun. These tokens are highly speculative but they’re pulling in a ton of new users. The chain has been nonstop busy.  \n  \nBNB Chain had a smaller slice of the volume, around 19 percent, but it still has the most applications built on it. It covers everything from DeFi to gaming to NFTs and that mix helps keep users active and money flowing. It also got a recent speed boost after the Maxwell upgrade, which reduced block time to around 0.75 seconds. It’s smoother now and feels more responsive.  \n  \nSolana, BNB Chain, and Tron are also still among the most used chains daily. Tron even passed Ethereum in daily USDT volume. It’s mostly large whale trades plus over a million smaller retail transactions happening every day. That kind of consistent flow shows that these chains actually have real communities using them.  \n  \nSure, some of this spike is probably driven by speculation and hype but even with that, 342 million transactions in one week is a serious number. It shows more people are actively using blockchains rather than just watching from the sidelines.  \n  \nFeels like something is starting to build again in the market.

The weather was fine, and the daily APY was thicc! the scams and rug pulls were there, but a lot more thought had gone into these projects. Ahhh OHM, TIME, STRONG.. take me back! Around 17,000 Alt coins existed back in those days (meaningful) with many of them dead. Liquidity was juicy after the COVID crash and the choice of alts to invest in MUCH smaller. Alts would pump 10x in a few hours. Launchpads were the real alpha and APY plays made you feel like you were really about to retire in a few weeks! Alas for many, it was simply moving liquidity to the early adopters.\n\nFast forward. It’s July 2025, we’ve had sunshine for a week in the UK and BTC.D is looking like it’s about to make moves. Many Altcoin moonbois from 2021 are now BTC maxis having joined the halls of BTC Valhalla with the once 2017 Altcoin moonbois! \nWhat’s left, a somewhat hopeful, slightly delusional and most certainly deep in the red group of crypto bros praying a 2025 AC Szn will set them free. \n\nAt the end of 2021 around 400k tokens had been born, lived and died. By the end of 2025 it’s estimated there will have been nearly 100 million tokens created. As of today it’s believed there are hundreds of thousands of active / alive projects\n\nThink about that number, think about how much liquidity is needed to nourish hundreds of thousands of projects this Altcoin season, draining liquidity - spread thin like butter. There simply isnt enough liquidity in the market to feed the hunger of all.\n\nSadly, MANY legitimate, great projects will see no more than maybe a 1-3x top 100s may see 50% to 1x.\n\nThis fabled Alt season will be like spreading butter over the world’s largest piece of toast.\n\nI ofcourse hope you all get back to break even.

By then, she was too hurt to keep talking, so I stepped in and told him straight: we know it’s a scam, we’ve reported both him and the site, and we’re done.

There is NO CURRENCY that is meaningfully measured by its market cap. No one says, \"Oh, the market cap of the Japanese yen is $X trillion,\" because that's not how currencies are measured. \n\nGDP is measured, yes. But GDP is a measurement of an economy's economic activity, not a way to measure currencies. If crypto analysts were honest, they'd try to measure crypto value using GDP, but crypto analysts also know that the actual GDP of crypto -- including Bitcoin -- is probably hilariously low compared to its \"market cap\" because trading activity generally isn't included in GDP. Which is probably why you don't see references to \"the GDP of Bitcoin\" or whatnot very often, if ever.\n\nAnd people in crypto intuitively know this. You KNOW that if anyone tries to sell even 0.1% of Bitcoin, the \"market cap\" of Bitcoin will be plummet. Anyone who quotes \"market cap\" to you as a reason to feel confident in crypto is either uninformed or actively trying to deceive you.\n\n\"Market cap\" for crypto is just another way to reiterate the price, but using bigger numbers, which is especially useful for small coins. It means absolutely nothing, and it is stupid that the crypto community harps it so much.", "content_size_bytes": 1567}

For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, take care of your family, yourselves, and try to enjoy the ride. \n\nA reporting note: I’ll focus on 2025 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports per month.  June’s extended report is on the 2023 Top Ten Portfolio.  For more data, you can check out the latest 2018-2024 Top Ten reports as well.", "content_size_bytes": 9473}

Lost a total of around $5,500 over the course of a year trading or \"trying to trade\" futures. That was an insane amount of money for me. We lived in a $600 apt and drove \"2nd hand subarus\". I learned the hard way to leave futures the fuckkk alone. \n\n I've made ALL that loss back and then some with some basic realizations. \n\n1. Never ever ever ever buy something that's going \"parabolic\" or up over 100% or more  in the last 24 hrs. Fuck \"fomo\" I don't allow myself to touch it. It'll correct HARD as soon as I buy in. Always does. I guess i have the \"touch\"\n\n2. I buy the \"blood\" or the \"fear\" graphs that look like the lowest end of a half pipe. When the price has bottomed out for months or weeks not going any lower, almost bouncing off an invisible wall. I buy, buy, buy. ☺️\n\n3. Make sure the project still has a \"pulse\". Website still active, Twitter, etc. No ominous rumors or \"de-listing\" in the immediate future. \n\n4. Total supply vs circulating supply. I like to see the total supply under 1 billion and the total & circulating exactly the same. This means its probably not a \"rug pull\" and some developer is going to dump a massive supply making the price plummet like a meteor. If it has a low supply, the price action can be insane with $100 turning into $1000 overnight at times. Sometimes more. More volatility, more risk, better if you aren't investing a lot.\n\n5. Once my initial investment doubles, I pull out half. This is very hard to do in the moment. But if you can find the self discipline, you'll risk nothing but profit. \n\n6. Unless I'm really really bullish about a certain project, I leave money (not too much) on the exchange with emergency stop losses in place. I use multiple exchanges. My initial investment money eventually pulled back into a secure wallet after my initial investment doubles.\n\n7. Personally I understand that I don't have the major liquidity required to invest and (actually make good money) in the safer options like BTC or ETH. Therefore I seek out low cap, low supply, projects that have previously done at least a 20×.\n\nI use a \"blanket strategy\" putting smaller amounts into multiple smaller projects. If one or two outshine the rest I'll buy more of those. Pretty simple.\n\n8. Most importantly, I set my stop losses and LEAVE it alone. I don't allow myself to check my portfolio very often. I go on with my hectic busy daily shit-show and let things grow in the background. This works best for me. My emotions can't be effected as easily if I don't allow myself to repeatedly check my balance throughout the day.\n\n9. Buy the fear, sell the greed. Don't buy the greed and sell the fear. \n\"When there's blood on the streets, buy, buy, buy.\" -Warren Buffet (I think I got the quote right...)\n\nThis basic strategy is the only one I found,  that finally works for me. Hopefully it'll help anyone new to this space. May the fuckary be in your favor. ", "content_size_bytes": 2932}

My seed phrase is [...]\n\nAn unscrupulous victim loads that seed phrase into their wallet and notices a large amount of some token, like 10,000 USDT in the wallet. However, the wallet is devoid of ETH/TRX/POLY/SOL/whatever other coin is needed to pay the network fee to withdraw the token. So the victim, intending to steal the tokens for themselves, send the required amount for the network fee into the wallet. However, to their dismay, the wallet is a 2-of-2 multisig and they can't actually send the tokens. The scammer, of course, controls both signers and uses this to withdraw the network fee that was sent by the victim.\n\nWhile this scam could theoretically work on any network, Atomic Shrimp showed it happening on TRON, which actually makes the most sense when you think about it a bit more: on Polygon and Solana, the network fees are so low that the victims would only need to send a minimal amount to have enough to send the tokens away, so the scammers would only be able to steal some 0.01 POLY from each victim. On ETH, the opposite problem is presented: network fees are so *high* that stealing the victim's network fee payment would consume most of it in real network fees to transfer the booty out. But TRON's weird resource system makes it uniquely profitable.\n\nFor those unaware, TRON has two resources: energy and bandwidth. All transactions consume bandwidth and it is the physical transaction size in bytes. Each TRON address is allocated 600 units of bandwidth for free which regenerates over a 24-hour period. Energy, meanwhile, represents computational power which is consumed by smart contracts (equivalent concept to gas on ETH-like chains). Energy is not free and must be paid for by burning TRX or by staking it. Transferring TRX is not considered a smart contract call and thus it only requires bandwidth, which is free. Calling a smart contract (like the `transfer` function of a TRC-20 token) will consume bandwidth **and** energy, and it is quite expensive since TRON punishes frequently-used contracts by making their callers pay extra penalty energy units. At the time of writing, a transfer of USDT burns 13.5 TRX (at a cost of ~0.30 USD per TRX).\n\nThus, the victim would have to transfer in around 20 TRX with which to pay the energy cost to be safe, which is around 6 USD. This can then be yoinked by the scammers at no cost since transferring TRX costs only bandwidth which is free.", "content_size_bytes": 3252}

More specifically, Monday July 14 2025 – Friday July 18 2025. This is an epic historical moment for Cryptocurrency as a whole that may define and redefine regulatory changes, specifically for the United States. This could have global effects and implications as other nations may learn from this experience and decisions made this week. I wish they called it “Cryptocurrency Week” to make it more official instead of a shortened “Crypto Week” which makes it feel like it’s a fad or not as important in my opinion. Nonetheless, I don’t think any of us can complain that they are scheduling an ENTIRE week for cryptocurrency discussions, which is a historical moment for the United States cryptocurrency space.\n\n# What is “Crypto Week”?\n\nThe United States House of Representatives has scheduled this week as “Crypto Week” to discuss and focus on all things cryptocurrency and related regulations and bills. They want to be the leaders for digital assets innovations and regulations while considering protection of the consumers and financial freedoms, or so they say. The week will include three major debates for “industry friendly” bills: Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, GENIUS Act, and CLARITY Act. We will get into more details on the Acts soon below. The hype and forecasted positive impact of Crypto Week in the cryptocurrency space has led a Bitcoin rally to new All Time Highs as well as a significant surge in cryptocurrency related stocks such as Coinbase, Micro Strategy, Block, Robinhood (unfortunately… I still have a long lasting bitter taste in my mouth anytime Robinhood is mentioned haha) and more.\n\nLet us get into the nitty gritty of the major legislations that will be under debate this week:\n\n# Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (CLARITY Act)\n\n·       H.R. 3633 - CLARITY Act\n\n·       During last month, June 2025, the act passed the committees vote and is slated for a full House vote this week.\n\n·       CLARITY Act hopes to define what a digital commodity is. Excludes stablecoins, derivatives, and securities!\n\n·       Act will grant the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) authority of digital commodities while the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will have authority over investment contracts and securities related to cryptocurrency.\n\n·       Bill includes a mature blockchain exemption, which lets decentralized blockchains to raise capital (limited to a cap of 75 Million USD in a 12 month period) exclusive of Securities and Exchange Commission registration. This change allows for reduced burdens of fundraising for projects that are compliant.\n\n·       Bill will require cryptocurrency dealers, brokers, and exchanges to register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission while remaining compliant of their “strict” guidelines on transparency and protecting consumer assets.\n\n·       Bill includes federal preemption for requiring KYC (know your customer) and AML (anti-money laundering) compliance as part of the already prevailing Bank Secrecy Act provisions. In short, this federal rule will supersede any State rules! I don’t agree with KYC… but we will have other non-KYC options hopefully!\n\n# GENIUS Act\n\n·       During last month, June 2025, the act was passed by the United States Senate.\n\n·       GENIUS Act’s primary target is for stablecoins which are  cryptocurrencies that are designed to always have the same or consistent value… stable in a sense. They must be pegged to another asset, such as the United States dollar as an example.\n\n·       Bill will require stablecoin creators/issuers have their assets backed by a reserve and to maintain the reserve requirement. This will protect consumers from liquidity failures… think Terra’s $LUNA fiasco… I hope this will ensure USDT and the rest of the stablecoins will need to PROVE their reserves!\n\n·       If there is a bankruptcy for a stablecoin, the Bill will give repayment rights priority to coin holders first, which hopefully means retail consumers such as you and me (disregard if you are from an institution reading this HAHA)\n\n·       Bill prohibits Congress and stablecoin senior execs from issuing stablecoins while they hold their public positions!\n\n·       Bill enforces anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism sanctions on stablecoin issuers.\n\n# Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21)\n\n·       FIT21 passed the House vote way back in 2024 from BOTH major parties (Democrats and Republicans).\n\n·       Bill is focused on bringing more clarity to regulations of digital assets which may include labeling tokens as commodities or securities (which I don’t agree with, cryptocurrency should be neither right?).\n\n·       Bill will classify the digitalized assets coming from decentralized blockchains as a commodity under CFTC regulations while less decentralized digitalized assets will stay under SEC regulations (again, I don’t agree with this classification and I’m extremely curious what requirements they will decide on that determines a decentralized token versus a “less” decentralized token).\n\n·       Bill will require decentralized blockchains to undergo a certification process.\n\n·       Bill will require both the CFTC and the SEC to create more rules for anti-fraud in regards to cryptocurrency and digital assets specifically.\n\nI am extremely excited that lawmakers and House leaders have designated an entire week for cryptocurrency discussions, promoting growth and innovation friendly agendas as a digital assets leader globally! This is a huge step forward towards mass adoptions of cryptocurrency and no nation can ignore cryptocurrencies any longer.\n\nMy hope is that these bills will offer clear, or at least clearer, legal certainty and promote innovations. As we see nations discussing stablecoins, we definitely need clearer rules for consumer confidence and to thwart future failures of current and new stablecoins. For example, I don’t know how Tether USDT has not proved that it’s backed by reserves (cash, equivalents, and Treasury Bills) and just hopes that we will take their “word” for it… Overall, I hope CBDCs are blocked for greater privacy for digital currencies.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Crypto Week and do you have any hopeful or expected impacts from the possible bills?", "content_size_bytes": 6555}

Only my personal information and their AI bot's messages have been removed.\n\nI'm not sure what else I can do at this point, other than warn people to steer clear. If anyone has any advice on what I can do to get my money back, I'd love to hear it.\n\n----\n\n**May 8**\n\n**Me:** I need more help. I need to inquire about the status of a Pro Exchange I made to TAO which I haven't been able to access for days.\n\n**Me:** Exchange Pro ID: `[REDACTED_TX_ID]`\n\n**Me:** The TAO seems to be inaccessible to me. I talked to support and they said they were working on it, but that was four days ago. If it's not getting fixed shortly, can I just get it reverted/refunded to something else?\n\n**Anthony:** Thank you for providing the details. I am reviewing the issue - please give me a moment.\n\n**Anthony:** Our team is still working on this case. At the moment, we don’t have any updates we can share with you.\n\n**Me:** Can you simply refund it or send it on to an external address?\n\n**Anthony:** In that case, we’re already working on processing the refund of your balance. Unfortunately, implementing the fix is taking some time.\n\n**Me:** Okay... hours, days, weeks? I need to have some idea what to expect.\n\n**Anthony:** I’ve requested an ETA from the team and will get back to you as soon as I receive it.\n\n**Me:** Okay, thank you.\n\n----\n\n**May 12**\n\n**Me:** I'd like an update on the status of my TAO exchange, or a refund. It's been a week now. (TX id: `[REDACTED_TX_ID]`)\n\n**Tim:** Hi, checking.\n\n**Tim:** Unfortunately, we have not finished fixing the issue as of yet, we deeply apologize for the prolonged wait and the inconvenience caused. We completely understand that a week for this case is unacceptable. Your funds are completely safe. We will keep you updated.\n\n**Me:** You can't even tell me if it'll be today or a month from now? I need something, here.\n\n**Tim:** We have not received a fixed ETA for the fix yet. I am currently checking with our team for more specific information. Our team has let us know that they will provide us with the update either today or tomorrow. The issue will most likely be fixed in the following week. Again, we deeply apologize for the wait. We will contact you via this chat or e-mail once there is an update.\n\n**Me:** Okay, good to hear, thank you.\n\n**Tim:** Thank you for reaching out as well. We will do our best to fix the issue.\n\n----\n\n**May 19**\n\n**Me:** This is me checking in a week later. I haven't heard anything and still don't see my TAO from exchange ID `[REDACTED_TX_ID]`.\n\n**Alejandro:** Hi! Checking! No updates as of yet, sir/madam. Thank you lots for addressing us, we kindly ask you to wait a bit.\n\n**Me:** I've been waiting for two weeks now. A week ago, they said they would have the update that day or the next, and it would most likely be fixed by now. I'm trying to be reasonable and patient, but at some point I'm going to have to start complaining loudly about this and hope it gets you guys to fix this. There's no way it should be taking this long for a simple fix or refund. Could someone explain to me the exact nature of the problem? Either the money is lost, in which case I should get a refund, or it's not, in which case it shouldn't be a challenge for one of your tech guys to forward the coins out of the address.\n\n**Alejandro:** Checking with the team once again, one moment, please.\n\n**Me:** Thank you.\n\n**Alejandro:** The nature of the issue is that TAO is not supported at the moment but we'll find the resolution. Waiting for an update, one moment, please, we'll notify you.\n\n**Me:** With Exchange Pro, you guys have custody of the money during the transfer. That means you have the TAO. Can't you simply send me its equivalent in ETH or BTC or whatever, and then you're welcome to take as long as you want working out the TAO problem?\n\n**Alejandro:** ETA is the next week, sir/madam. It'll be done! Rest assured.\n\n**Me:** Yes, you said that last week. What is the problem with what I suggested? You have the TAO. You're having problems with it. Just send me its value in some other coin, and keep it for yourself.\n\n**Alejandro:** There are technical nuances that would be a problem. Our team will resolve this situation and you'll be notified as soon as it's done.\n\n**Me:** Okay, but if it's still not done a week from now, I am going to start complaining loudly on forums and all that crap. Hopefully it won't come to that. Thanks, have a good day.\n\n**Alejandro:** We assure you that the issue will be resolved, sir. It just needs a bit of waiting. Thank you so much for your patience, we sincerely appreciate it. Have a good one and keep in touch please.\n\n----\n\n**May 27**\n\n**Me:** It's been yet another week. I hope this is resolved?\n\n**Kate:** Hello! Could you please give a brief description of the issue?\n\n**Me:** I've been waiting three weeks on my TAO from pro tx: `[REDACTED_TX_ID]`. (See earlier conversation.)\n\n**Kate:** That's odd. According to our records, the conversion with the ID `[REDACTED_TX_ID]` has finished, the TAO should be in your account.\n\n**Me:** Am I talking to an actual person? See the previous discussion with three other agents regarding this transaction. The TAO disappeared.\n\n**Kate:** My apologies, let me check again. Our development team provided a new ETA - they said the issue is being worked on and should be resolved within this week. I'm very sorry for this inconvenience.\n\n**Me:** You've been saying that every time since the first day. Again, since they are the ones that have the TAO, can they simply keep that and manually refund me the equivalent so that I can get this taken care of?\n\n**Kate:** I will try to forward that request to our team, but since it's outside standard procedure, it will be most likely denied.\n\n**Me:** Please do forward that request. Can you at the very least give me a firm ETA? You said it will be finished this week, so I will be able to get my money out by Friday? How about if not, they do a manual refund? I feel I have been reasonable, but this is getting ridiculous.\n\n**Kate:** I'm sorry, but I'm working with the information that is being provided to me by our development team. They gave me an ETA of \"Within this week\". That's all I can say, unfortunately.\n\n**Me:** Please pass along my request that they either ACTUALLY get it done this time, or go ahead and manually refund me. Thank you.\n\n----\n\n**June 14**\n\n**Me:** It's a month and a half now and I've heard nothing and I *still* see no TAO from my pro tx `[REDACTED_TX_ID]`. This is totally unacceptable. What's the deal?\n\n**Benjamin:** Hello, let me check. My apologise for delay. Still checking information. We apologise. I forwarded it over to the technical team, they are dealing with this issue. Please contact us with in next 2 days if your problem is not solved.\n\n**Me:** It's been a month and a half. Every time I check in, I've been told it'll be fixed or I'll have an update within a day or two. What happens in 2 days when it's still not fixed, because I promise you it won't be. Just send me a simple goddamned refund or manually send it out, already, this is nuts.\n\n**Benjamin:** We are very sorry that this is causing so much inconvenience. I've told the team to take care of your issue first.\n\n**Me:** They've had a month and a half to take care of the issue. You have ownership of the coins, so just send me the equivalent, and then you can take as long as you want to fix your buggy code. Otherwise I'm out of ideas, and I'll post this on Reddit and hope somebody out there can help, or at least give you some bad press.\n\n**Benjamin:** Your issue is being processed. We apologise for the long wait. Please contact us in 2 days if the problem is not resolved.\n\n**Me:** And if it isn't resolved?\n\n**Benjamin:** We will do our best to resolve this issue.\n\n**Me:** So if it isn't resolved, you'll ask me to wait another two days. Do you have a supervisor or someone I can talk to? This should not be so fucking hard, and I'm out of patience.\n\n**Benjamin:** My apologise for delay. Our tech team process this issue. Could you please provide me with your email to contact with you? Our tech team will be able to solve the problem by 07:00 a.m. (UTC). At which time we will write to you by mail as you will need a conversion from your side, which we will request manually and you will receive your funds.\n\n**Me:** `[REDACTED_EMAIL]`\n\n**Benjamin:** Thank you, we will write you.\n\n**Me:** I'll be expecting it.\n\n**Benjamin:** Thank you for understanding.\n\n----\n\n**June 18**\n\n**Me:** It's been another few days, and I never got an email. Let me know if the problem's fixed now, or if we can go ahead with the refund.\n\n**Anthony:** I’ve requested an update from the technical team regarding the resolution of your case and will get back to you as soon as I receive it. The team is currently exploring ways to convert your TAO token into another asset, which would allow you to withdraw your funds — even if in a different form. We’re actively working on this solution, and I’ll let you know as soon as there’s any progress.\n\n**Me:** Good to hear, anything I can exchange would be just fine by me. So later today, or what?\n\n**Anthony:** I expect to receive an update within 1–2 hours and will reach out to you to coordinate the next steps or inform you of any further developments.\n\n**Me:** Excellent.\n\n*(2 hours later)*\n\n**Anthony:** I'm sorry to inform you, but unfortunately, it will not be possible to resolve this task within the next 24 hours, as much as we would like to. At the moment, the team has attempted to perform the required conversion, but the system is refusing to process it. To fix the issue, we will either need to integrate a patch or explore an alternative workaround. I have escalated the issue as far as currently possible, and the team will work even harder on this than before. I sincerely apologize, and we are aiming to resolve this matter by next Monday, June 23, or to propose another viable solution by then.\n\n**Me:** Can you just agree that someone will just manually send me the equivalent coinage by then, if you haven't fixed the problem?\n\n**Tony:** We will resolve the issue in any case - it’s only a matter of time. For now, we’re sticking to the previously mentioned timeframes, and moving forward, everything will be handled in accordance with our standard policies, without exceptions.\n\n**Anthony:** Сompensation is an option. We are also considering it as a possible solution to the issue, but we will proceed with it only if we are unable to implement another resolution.\n\n----\n\n**June 29**\n\n**Me:** Well, it's been another two weeks. Is it fixed, or can I kindly get my compensation now?\n\n**Tony:** Hello! Could you please clarify in more detail what your question is about, so I can assist you more accurately? I see the previous chats; I will review them now.\n\n**Me:** See previous conversation. In short: pro transaction `[REDACTED_TX_ID]`, I never got my TAO from it, and it was two months ago.\n\n**Tony:** I have requested the information and will get back to you once we receive a response.\n\n*(Later, a different agent responds)*\n\n**Benjamin:** Hello, our tech team still working of this issue. We will contact with you within next 12 hours. Thank you for understanding.\n\n**Me:** Yeah, I'll be holding my breath.\n\n**Benjamin:** Thank you.\n\n----\n\n**June 30**\n\n**Me:** It's been 12 hours, and I've not been contacted.\n\n**Anthony:** Unfortunately, no update has been received by our team member within the past 12 hours. I’ll check the status of your case now. Great news! The technical team responsible for the issue has confirmed that a fix has been implemented to prevent such situations from happening again. They are now continuing to work on resolving the active cases to return funds to affected users. We’re currently awaiting an update.\n\n**Me:** And when should I expect to hear about that?\n\n**Anthony:** I’ve requested information regarding this matter and will get back to you with an update shortly. I haven’t received a specific ETA yet, but work is actively ongoing, so I’m hopeful we’ll get one within the next few hours.\n\n**Me:** Okay, thanks.\n\n**July 1**\n\n**Me:** Well, it's been a few hours.\n\n**Alejandro:** We'll notify you as soon as we get an update, sir/madam. I assure you that the process is being done by our team.\n\n----\n\n**July 7**\n\n**Me:** It's been another week.\n\n**Tim:** Hi, checking.\n\n**Tessa:** Hi! Unfortunately there is no update at the moment. We deeply apologize for the inconvenience caused. Our team is still working on it.\n\n----\n\n**July 10**\n\n**Me:** Get me a human. And is my refund ready?\n\n**Alejandro:** Hi, sir/madam, unfortunately, no updates as of yet. Our team needs a bit more time to figure out the issue.\n\n**Me:** And now?\n\n**Alejandro:** Sir/madam, it'll take some time for sure. Please wait for an update from us.\n\n**Me:** I have been waiting for two and a half months. Please put me on with your supervisor.\n\n**Alejandro:** Sir/madam, I'm here to help and guide you. You will be notified about any updates.\n\n*Full disclosure: At this point I decide to explain the situation to ChatGPT, and have it advise on how to move forward, since I was getting nowhere.*\n\n**Me:**\n\n>Pro Exchange ID `[REDACTED_TX_ID]` has been outstanding since 4 May—75 days without delivery.\n\n**Alejandro:** Sir/madam, we understand your frustration and deeply apologise that it takes longer that you might have expected but such cases are complicated and require thorough viewing. We're kindly asking for your patience and understanding. Please, wait for an update from us.\n\n**Me:** Acknowledgement noted, but a generic apology does not answer my request.\n\n>**Action items (no later than 17:00 UTC 18 July):** 1. Confirm you have escalated this to a senior supervisor and provide their name, title, direct email, and your internal ticket/incident ID. 2. Give me a firm ETA in hours for one of the two outcomes already outlined:  • TAO sent to `[REDACTED_TAO_WALLET]`, or  • USDT/USDC/BTC/ETH refund to `[REDACTED_ETH_WALLET]`.\n\n**Alejandro:** Sir/madam, every single piece of information is forwarded. We cannot proceed with a refund unless the investigation is done and we don't provide such information. Thank you so much for understanding. We're kindly asking you to wait for an update.\n\n**Me:** Alejandro — Your refusal to give supervisory contact or even a rough ETA after 75 days is unacceptable and violates basic consumer‑protection standards. This is my final notice before formal escalation.\n\n>• Today, I will file complaints with FinCEN, the relevant Attorney General, and the Saint Vincent & the Grenadines FSA, and I will publish this entire chat log on Reddit, X/Twitter, and Trustpilot. • You have 4 hours from the timestamp of this message to prevent that by providing ONE of the following with a verifiable TX‑ID:  1) Full TAO transfer to `[REDACTED_TAO_WALLET]`, or  2) Refund in USDT/USDC/BTC/ETH to `[REDACTED_ETH_WALLET]`.\n\n**Alejandro:** Sir/madam, I promise you that our team is working on your request and we'll get to you with an update once we have one. Checking with the team, one moment.\n\n**Me:** Alejandro—thanks for checking. I’ll wait 30 minutes for your concrete update. If I have neither a TX‑ID nor the supervisor’s contact by then, I’ll proceed with the formal complaints exactly as outlined.\n\n**Alejandro:** Checked it, sir/madam. Our team is indeed working on resolving this situation but I'm afraid we cannot give ETA here.\n\n**Me:** Alejandro — I’ve asked repeatedly for two very simple things — (1) a supervisor’s contact and (2) an ETA in hours. You’ve declined both. Per my prior notice, I am now proceeding with formal complaints to FinCEN, the relevant Attorney General, and other regulators, and will publish this chat log publicly. You can still stop that paperwork only by providing, within the next 2 hours:\n\n>• a verifiable TX‑ID for either  a) the TAO transfer to `[REDACTED_TAO_WALLET]`, or  b) a refund in USDT/USDC/WBTC/ETH to `[REDACTED_ETH_WALLET]`.\n\n**Alejandro:** Sir/madam,it'll unfortunately take a bit more time for our team to complete your request. Please, kidnly asking you to wait a bit. We promise that it'll be done and you'll be notified about it.\n\n**Me:** I've kindly waited for 75 days. You've got just over an hour left.\n\n**Alejandro:** Sir/madam, please kindly understand, this cannot be done in some hours. We need a nit more time to do a research and understand how to resolve this.\n\n**Me:** YOU'VE HAD TWO AND A HALF MONTH. How you RESOLVE it is sending me MY MONEY. It's not goddamned rocket science.\n\n**Me:** I'm going to go ahead and start posting about this. If I get my money before tomorrow, I'll take them down, but otherwise, I'll go ahead with alerting the regulatory agencies in the morning.", "content_size_bytes": 17225}

SOL dropped from $250 down to under $10 in December 2022, then slowly climbed back to similar highs by November 2024. The pattern looks solid when you zoom out..... and the key level everyone's watching is $170. If SOL breaks above that with strong volume, the first target around $295 is totally reasonable based on how these patterns usually play out.\n\nBut here's where I need to pump the brakes on the $2,700 target. At that price, we're talking about a market cap of roughly $1.4 trillion. To put that in perspective..... Apple sits around $3.5 trillion, so we'd be talking about Solana becoming 40% the size of the world's most valuable company. Is it impossible?? No, but it would require adoption levels that are way beyond what we see today like crazy \n\nWhat I find more interesting than the price targets are the current market dynamics. Open interest in SOL futures is near all time highs, which means big money is positioning heavily. The weighted funding rate has been positive for five days straight..... which tells us that traders are literally paying premiums to hold long positions because they're so bullish.\n\nThe stablecoin supply on Solana jumped from $10.5 billion to $11.4 billion just this month, which is an 8.5% increase. When I see liquidity flowing into an ecosystem like this.  Plus that Pump fun event last week processed $448 million in token sales in 12 minutes without breaking the network..... that's genuinely impressive ( they pulled silicon valley rt) \n\nThe technical setup is solid and if SOL breaks $170 decisively, I could see $295 happening relatively quickly. Beyond that, each level becomes exponentially harder because of the market cap math. But if it fails to break $170, we could see a pullback to $136 or even $100 .\n\nThe next few weeks around that $170 level are gonna be crucial for determining if this breakout is the real potential or just another failed pattern. Even if it get to half of it , it’s huge amounts of wealth. ", "content_size_bytes": 2063}

Like moving ETH to wETH.\n\t2.\tToken gets burned, new token is minted\n→ Taxable. IRS sees this as disposing of an asset and receiving a new one.

Paying in crypto = a sale of that crypto.\n\t4.\tBridge involves a cross-chain swap (like ETH to AVAX)\n→ Definitely taxable. That’s a full-on trade.\n\nThe kicker: most tax tools don’t track this well. If you’re bridging and the system logs it as “internal transfer” when it was actually a swap, your taxes will be wrong.\n\nI personally use software that flags bridge behavior and calculates what actually happened under the hood.\n\nSource : read here on [awaken](https://awaken.tax/media/article/is-bridging-crypto-taxable)", "content_size_bytes": 1067}

Now, you won’t need to give your name, address, and Social Security number to make a trade on a decentralized exchange.\n\n# What was the IRS trying to do?\n\nThis all started back in 2021, when the Infrastructure Bill passed. It quietly expanded the definition of a cryptocurrency “broker” to include anyone “facilitating digital asset transfers.”\n\nThe Treasury interpreted that to include **non-custodial DeFi protocols**. They wanted decentralized apps to be subject to the same rules as Robinhood or Coinbase: collect user data, file 1099s, and report trades. Even though these apps have no way of identifying customers, and have 0 infrastructure in place to send out tax forms. \n\nIt wasn’t just impossible to implement—it would’ve fundamentally broken DeFi.\n\n# How this affects Solana DeFi\n\nIf this rule had gone into effect:\n\n* You would’ve needed to KYC to use Jupiter/Raydium and other exchange\n* These platforms would have to figure out how to send thousands of 1099 forms (it's not like they have huge compliance teams like Coinbase) \n* Every wallet you used (Phantom, Backpack, etc.) would’ve  been pulled into the compliance dragnet\n\nLuckily, because of pushback from crypto advocates the rule is now gone. According to [The Block](https://www.theblock.co/amp/post/362013/treasury-department-irs-remove-controversial-crypto-broker-tax-rule-requiring-non-custodial-service-providers-to-file-customer-transaction-info), The IRS and Treasury have officially removed the rule from the Code of Federal Regulations.\n\n# So… do I still have to pay taxes?\n\nIf the IRS is reading this: I’m totally paying my taxes on everything ;)\n\nBut seriously though, if you’re planning to move money through centralized exchanges, you should report your taxes (not that hard if you don’t have anything complex, just use CoinLedger/another crypto tax software). Remember, Coinbase/other centralized exchanges are still subject to tax reporting rules. \n\nI think the best thing about this is that any developer in their garage can spin up a decentralized app without having to worry about sending tax forms to users.\n\n**TL;DR**: Big win for crypto investors, DeFi protocols won’t be required to KYC users anymore", "content_size_bytes": 2764}

It combines a cloud-native IDE with agentic AI models trained exclusively on over 22 million lines of Solana code and more than 130,000 task-specific instructions.\n\nDevelopers can describe a program's functionality in plain English and receive a Solana program that includes account structures, instruction handlers, tests, and documentation. \n\nCodigo provides a library of templates such as token vesting, staking, swaps, NFT minting with Metaplex, compressed NFTs, and DeFi primitives like bonding curves, escrows, and lending protocols, and also features integrated static analysis and vulnerability detection. \n\nPlanned features include frontend and backend integration, performance analytics, and a one-click deployment pipeline with automated testing and verification steps.\n\n[**Codigo**](https://codigo.ai/?ref=blog.colosseum.com)\n\n# 🏆 Hackathon Playbook\n\nSuperteam Japan has released a Hackathon Playbook to help teams build high-quality projects and increase their chances of winning one of the world’s largest crypto hackathons. \n\nDeveloped from interviews with past winners, judges, and teams, the playbook outlines a proven framework tested during the recent Breakout Hackathon.\n\nThe playbook focuses on five major areas:\n\n1. **Hackathon Canvas:** Use structured tools like the *Lean Canvas* and *SAT Canvas* to clarify your problem, solution, target users, and strategic advantages early in the build process.\n2. **Pitch Deck:** Learn what makes a compelling deck, including best and worst practices, and a sample agenda for organizing your presentation effectively.\n3. **Iteration:** Emphasize continuous refinement of your product, messaging, and demo based on feedback during the hackathon timeline.\n4. **Hype Video:** Create a short, engaging teaser to generate attention from the community, judges, and potential users.\n5. **Pitch Video:** Follow a detailed checklist to structure your final pitch video. \n\nThe playbook also includes a checklist and a list of “red flag” words to avoid, based on common feedback from past judging panels.\n\nThe guide is designed to launch a startup within the constraints of a hackathon.\n\n[**Superteam Japan Hackathon Playbook**](https://superteam-japan.gitbook.io/hackathon-playbook?ref=blog.colosseum.com)\n\n# 💰 Drift Foundation Builder Fund\n\nDrift Foundation’s Builder Fund will distribute up to 100k DRIFT, with as much as 25k DRIFT per team, to accelerate mobile-first trading interfaces that execute on Drift perpetuals over Solana. \n\nAny product that routes orders to Drift qualifies, such as lightweight perps, Telegram bots, gamified views that replace price charts, or social copy-trading apps. \n\nProposals are judged on originality, team strength, and demonstrated progress. In addition to token funding, selected teams receive marketing, strategic introductions, and technical guidance.\n\nApplications are open now and close on Sept 1, 2025, and awards are issued against agreed milestones.\n\n[**Drift Foundation Builder Fund: Mobile Trading**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QflQan6UJ62BuZloG-NcbUENG247HdlJjE9DOCGdbk0/edit?tab=t.0&ref=blog.colosseum.com)\n\n# 🧮 Tokenomics Design 201\n\nThe Tokenomics Design 201 report from nonce Classic offers a detailed framework for designing, modeling, and executing a token strategy, with an emphasis on practical implementation.\n\nIt begins by defining the role of tokenomics in a project’s architecture, and describes how to plan a token’s supply structure, covering maximum supply, stakeholder allocations, and unlock mechanisms like full unlock, vesting, and emissions. \n\nThe TGE simulator (to be released soon) is a spreadsheet modeling tool that lets teams simulate and customize every major component of a token launch. \n\nUsers input parameters such as token allocations, unlock schedules, emission rates, and revenue-sharing strategies, and the simulator dynamically calculates token flows, circulating supply, and dilution over time. \n\nThe tool references real-world benchmarks from top projects, enabling teams to start with proven templates and adapt them to their specific needs. \n\nIt also includes visualizations and automatic calculations for vesting schedules, revenue triggers, and stakeholder rewards, giving founders and developers a data-driven way to design and test their tokenomics before deployment.\n\nThis guide offers a complete playbook for creating a token strategy that aligns with product goals, user incentives, and long-term sustainability. By using the simulator, teams can visualize the impact of different design choices before launch, reducing risk and increasing the chance of product-token fit.\n\n[**Tokenomics Design 201: From Theory to Execution**](https://docsend.com/view/kdmqst2b25a5rr75?ref=blog.colosseum.com)\n\n# ⚡ Quick Hits\n\n[25x Faster Anchor tests for Solana with LiteSVM (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vsOzQ1qywU&ref=blog.colosseum.com) \\- QuickNode\n\n[Pinocchio: The No-Dependency Framework for Solana Smart Contracts](https://x.com/avhidotsol/status/1941379738146427243?ref=blog.colosseum.com) \\- u/avhidotsol\n\n[Solana Launchpads Trends, Token Performance, and Platform Traction](https://x.com/ledger_top/status/1942641637261480085?ref=blog.colosseum.com) \\- u/ledger\\_top\n\n[Introducing Arcium’s $65K Developer Fellowship](https://x.com/ArciumHQ/status/1940749948125106361?ref=blog.colosseum.com) \\- u/ArciumHQ\n\n[Live with Anatoly -

In particular, it wants to explore using stablecoins to settle transactions involving tokenized real-world assets (RWA) such as digital bonds and real estate. Compared to other jurisdictions, real estate tokenization is comparatively advanced in Japan, with fairly regular issuances by real estate firms and financial institutions.\n\nPreviously Minna no Bank was involved in [stablecoin experiments](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/bank-stablecoin-gu-funding/) with two smaller Japanese banks, Tokyo Kiraboshi Financial Group and Shikoku Bank. In that case it used the Japan Open Chain blockchain, an Ethereum compatible chain with the validators comprising Japanese corporates, including the bank. The founder of the blockchain, Gu Technologies, also has a stablecoin subsidiary that conducted those trials.\n\nBy expanding from Japan Open Chain to Solana, this latest move shows institutions’ desire to engage with larger public blockchains that offer broader reach.\n\nTIS, the IT partner, is involved in other Japanese stablecoin initiatives, including partnering with Japan’s second largest bank [SMBC to explore a stablecoin](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/japanese-banking-giant-smbc-plans-avalanche-stablecoin-report/) issuance. Fireblocks is also a partner in that initiative that plans to use the Avalanche blockchain.\n\n", "content_size_bytes": 2372}

3**](https://blog.colosseum.com/introducing-colosseum-accelerator-cohort-3)\n\n# 🤫 Arcium Confidential SPL Token\n\nArcium announced the Confidential SPL Token, a proposed Solana token standard that natively encrypts amounts, balances, and metadata while preserving the familiar SPL-Token developer experience.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d2s50vy34zaf1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0120c55633f6ad12360f869fd01a920a1e098d1\n\nThe new standard unifies four pieces of existing infrastructure into one program set, eliminating the headaches that stalled earlier privacy efforts: \n\n* SPL Token\n* Token-2022\n* Confidential Transfer extension\n* Arcium’s MPC-powered encrypted compute\n\nOnchain programs can now see and move confidential balances, senders can create accounts for recipients, and any public SPL asset can be “wrapped” into a canonical confidential version on demand. \n\nThese updates unlock practical, privacy-by-default use cases such as institutional payroll, vendor payments, private stablecoins, and confidential DeFi or RWA trading.\n\nThe specification is in active development with ecosystem partners, and early-access slots for selected teams will be announced soon.\n\n[**Introducing the Development of Confidential SPL Token**](https://www.arcium.com/articles/confidential-spl-token?ref=blog.colosseum.com)\n\n# 📜 Solana Ecosystem Report\n\nThe Solana Ecosystem Report by Helius for the first half of 2025 shares how Solana has moved from potential to execution. \n\nIt records fifteen months of uninterrupted uptime, daily throughput north of 160 million transactions at sub-penny fees, and monthly real economic value topping half a billion dollars, figures that now outpace every other chain. \n\nDeveloper momentum is growing as well: \n\n* More than 7,600 new builders joined in 2024\n* Colosseum’s Breakout set a hackathon submission record\n* Superteam network is seeding projects in twenty countries\n\nOn-chain activity is showing strength too. \n\nSolana is handling four-fifths of all DEX trades, its stablecoin float has risen 7x in eighteen months, and regulated asset managers such as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton are bringing tokenized funds and credit vehicles onto Solana. \n\nAt the infrastructure layer, multiple independent validator clients, the Confidential SPL work, and forthcoming Firedancer and Alpenglow upgrades aim to cut finality below 150ms while slashing validator costs.\n\nCase studies on Helium Mobile, Hivemapper, Baxus, and R3 show how Solana’s low-latency architecture, token-extension toolkit, and mobile stack translate into successful consumer products.\n\nThis report provides key insights for anyone building apps that tap both consumer growth and the incoming wave of institutional capital.\n\n[**Solana Ecosystem Report (H1 2025)**](https://www.helius.dev/blog/solana-ecosystem-report-h1-2025?ref=blog.colosseum.com)\n\n# 🏦 RWAs in Onchain Finance\n\nThis in-depth RWA report from Redstone shows that tokenization has moved well past trial projects. \n\nThe value of non-stablecoin RWAs on public blockchains climbed from about 5 billion dollars in 2022 to more than 24 billion dollars by June 2025.\n\nPrivate credit now accounts for roughly 14 billion dollars and tokenized US Treasuries for 7.5 billion, with six funds led by BlackRock’s BUIDL product holding almost ninety percent of that Treasury pool. \n\nThe authors identify two remaining technical hurdles of native confidentiality and reliable pricing feeds, and point to Solana’s forthcoming Confidential SPL standard and RedStone’s multi-source NAV oracles as the pieces that can let programs manage encrypted balances without sacrificing composability.\n\nFor founders building RWA applications on Solana the full report details the architectures, compliance frameworks, and liquidity pathways that have already attracted large institutions such as Apollo, Ondo, and Franklin Templeton to the network. \n\n[**Real-World Assets in Onchain Finance

What's fascinating isn't the raw numbers... it's the behavior patterns emerging. 4.2k traders today versus 6.6k yesterday, but average trade size jumped from $763 to $1.2k. Classic market maturation signal. The curious retail money is filtering out, leaving behind users who see genuine utility in trading SPY and TSLA through blockchain rails.\n\nThe infrastructure shift is profound. Kraken's tokenized U.S. stocks on Solana represent a fundamental reimagining of market access. Apple, Tesla, Nvidia, and other major equities now available as xStocks, backed 1:1 with underlying assets. Non-U.S. users across Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Asia suddenly have 24/7 access, completely bypassing traditional Wall Street trading hours.\n\n55% of volume concentrated in SPY, 15% TSLA. That's not random speculation... that's strategic positioning. Someone understands they can maintain broad market exposure while leveraging Solana's settlement advantages.\n\nThe cross chain arbitrage possibilities are genuinely compelling. Picture hedging SPY exposure through tokenized equities while maintaining derivative positions elsewhere. The composability factor opens up risk management strategies that simply don't exist in traditional markets.\n\nThe technical implementation through Backed is elegant... freely transferable tokens preserving economic exposure to underlying assets, all settling on one of the fastest networks available. No complex infrastructure dependencies, just clean execution.\n\nThe tax reporting gets messy fast. These tokenized stocks sit somewhere between securities and crypto and it got easier after using [Awaken.tax](http://Awaken.tax) to handle the classification automatically .\n\nThe liquidity challenge remains real. These volumes are impressive for  infrastructure, but still orders of magnitude below institutional requirements. Classic network effect problem.\n\nWhat's strategically interesting is how this positions Solana in tokenized asset settlement. While Ethereum dominates DeFi, Solana's performance characteristics align perfectly with high frequency equity applications.\n\nThe growth trajectory and user behavior suggest genuine product market fit emerging...", "content_size_bytes": 2304}

A recent proposal that would have cut Solana's inflation to nearly 0 was stopped because YOU weren’t natively staked. Stop giving control of the network to entities that prioritize short-term profit over SOL’s long-term value and future.\n\n- Native staking can earn thousands of dollars in free airdrops. Many Solana projects have already paid each native staker thousands of USD worth of free tokens just for simply natively staking. You willingly give up these rewards to Robinhood, Coinbase, etc by staking with them! Stop!\n\n\nSOL could easily be priced MUCH higher right now if upgrade 228 had passed and these sell walls were removed.\n\nStop staking on exchanges. You're burning money, slowing Solana’s progress, losing drops and suppressing the price. It only takes one click on Phantom Wallet to safely and easily stake your SOL!\n\n**FAQ**\n\n- Is it safe to natively stake: Yes! It's safer than staking on an exchange. You incur no additional risk natively staking.\n\n- Can I use hardware wallets and Phantom: Yes! Use both. You stake directly in phantom. \n\n- Should I sign smart contracts with the same address all my SOL is staked on: No! Use a savings address for your stake and a spending address for defi. \n\n- How long does it take to unstake: 0-3 days. 1-2 days average. You can instantly unstake if you don't want to wait with services like Jito and Sanctum.\n\n- Can I earn an additional 1-2% staking natively from MEV rewards: Yes! You can harvest all your additional MEV rewards from Jito's website if you staked with a Jito powered validator. Many sites help you identify the best validators.\n\n- Is there slashing when staking: Not yet. This will eventually apply to all stakers. Even exchanges. You're unlikely to ever to get slashed, and if you do you only lose some of your rewards.\n\n- How will I know which validators use my authority to vote for upgrades the way I would want to vote: Check their X accounts. Solana soon upgrading where you can force your validator to point your delegation to your vote preference. \n\n- Is staking on Phantom or other soft wallets hard: NO! If you can open a Coinbase account you can stake on chain. Save your seed offline. NEVER share it. Buy a ledger if you have more than 2 weeks salary worth of staked SOL for ultimate comfort and safety. \n\n- Are there any additional perks: YES! Many have earned thousands of dollars in airdrops by simply staking on chain. Even airdrops on those airdrops. This is real. If you stake with Robinhood, Coinbase, etc you lose these drops. Furthermore, moving SOL on chain prevents large exchanges from using YOUR SOL to dump the market and slowly buy back cheaper. \n\n- Are there any downsides besides my time: NO!

Start trading quality. It's much harder to lose when you're not trading tokens that all trend to zero.\n\nWith everything unfolding right in front of you, this is the easiest time in Solana's history to say, \"Ok, clearly everything is happening on Solana.

Maybe, I will just wait a week or two for the 9 spot ETFs to be approved and invest in one of them.\n\nAlso, I noticed that Blackrock who has the biggest spot ETFs in the other 2 coins, has not filed to open a spot SOL ETF.

That means for every $1 of Djed minted, $4 to $8 worth of ADA is locked up in a smart contract.\n\nThis naturally leads me to wonder:\n\n* Will this lockup of ADA affect the circulating supply significantly?\n* Could it put upward pressure on price in the long term, especially if Djed adoption increases?\n* Or is it still too early to expect Djed to have real impact?\n\nWould love to hear thoughts from people who are deeper into Cardano DeFi.

Unlike some other wallets, Yoroi doesn't automatically make rewards available for transactions; they remain in the stake address until you manually withdraw them.*  \n   \n*That’s why you were able to send your original staked amount of ADA without any issue — it was part of your spendable balance. But since the rest of your ADA was in rewards, you couldn’t send that portion until it was withdrawn.*  \n   \n*Because your wallet had no remaining ADA after sending out the original staked ADA, there wasn’t enough to cover the transaction fee required for withdrawing rewards. That’s why you had to send a small amount of ADA back into the wallet first.*  \n   \n*Once you did that, you were able to withdraw the rewards from your stake address into your regular wallet address, making them fully spendable.*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nHey guys,  \nI ran into a weird situation using Yoroi wallet and wondering if anyone else has experienced this or found a solid workaround.\n\nTL;DR:\n\n* I had some ADA staked and accumulated a handful of ADA as staking rewards.\n* I went to withdraw rewards, and got prompted to participate in Cardano governance \n* I chose \"Abstain\" to keep things simple.\n* I was able to successfully undelegate and withdraw the principal, but the rewards are still sitting there.\n* Now, if I click on the “Withdraw” and “Undelegate” buttons, they dont do anything , and I can’t send the rewards because they don't appear in the sendable “Assets” section.\n* So my ADA in rewards are effectively stuck \n\n# Note:\n\n* Yoroi shows the staking rewards correctly in the wallet summary.\n* I confirmed I selected an on-chain governance option (Abstain).\n* I have enough ADA in the wallet to pay fees.\n* Refreshed the app, restarted browser, no luck.\n\nAssistance appreciated!", "content_size_bytes": 2132}

DDD - Decentralised Deputy Diary. Of course, there is nothing special about this idea. I assume some other DReps might do or are doing something similar. That's simple - if you have a big stake delegated to you, some whales who support you - that's one situation. But if your stake is tiny, you need to \"fight\" for every delegator in these highly competitive conditions. I will write my thoughts about voting decisions as well as about everything related to Cardano and blockchain governance.\n\nCardano Decentralised Deputy Diary.

Being in a market economy, we can have as many voting sites as the community would like to. But we already have Gov.tools (to be honest, at the moment I prefer this site). And it's also another way to develop such services: with the help of Cardano entrepreneurs or Project Catalyst, etc. That's why my vote is \"No\" at the moment.\n\nThat's my decision in brief.

In this article, we will describe these techniques: deduplication, tombstoning, coloring, sharding, and collateralization.\n\n[Tombstoning](https://preview.redd.it/wurlypreu8af1.jpg?width=1147&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c1f91c4f4221a231d713a99e046ef2941b7a33ce)\n\n\n\n[Coloring](https://preview.redd.it/pcvhmosgu8af1.jpg?width=782&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=83701a6a56bcf402d22fd215396904740e807296)\n\n[Sharding](https://preview.redd.it/djj2rzviu8af1.jpg?width=711&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e07295f624bd2f693bf1c65e1d2c02944471958d)\n\n\n\n\n\n[Collateralization](https://preview.redd.it/7v4le19lu8af1.jpg?width=755&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d998b68d0a8f4e2249c9fc46c0c185e4adb51109)\n\n**Read the article:**\n\n[https://cexplorer.io/article/resolving-duplicate-and-conflicting-transactions-in-leios](https://cexplorer.io/article/resolving-duplicate-and-conflicting-transactions-in-leios)", "content_size_bytes": 1504}

Traditional methods of verification are often manual, insecure, or prone to manipulation.\n\nTo solve this, I propose a solution that leverages Cardano blockchain technology to ensure transparency and trust.\n\nThe system works by generating a unique hash value for any given file and storing it immutably on the blockchain. Alongside the hash, key metadata such as the creator’s name, address, and an optional description are recorded. This enables anyone to later verify whether a file is genuine and trace it back to its original source, simply by comparing its current hash to the one on-chain.\n\nFor businesses, this offers a powerful way to:\n\nProve file authenticity and integrity\n\nProtect intellectual property\n\nEstablish legal traceability\n\nBuild trust with cross-border partners and clients\n\nWhether you're in legal, creative, tech, or manufacturing — this tool provides a simple yet robust layer of vendor-independent, decentral verification for your digital assets.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1lo9452/video/4b9naslgh3af1/player\n\n", "content_size_bytes": 1261}

This is where a lot of smart people seem to be gathering, and I live with the spark of hope that Cardano, with the right collective guidance, can indeed become a globally common system.\n\nHowever, I was shocked in recent months to discover (listening to one of Charles' videos) that 'one ADA one vote' is not the intended system, and that despite all the modern tools in use and best practices, that this has been left to a 'we'll figure it out later' approach. I always assumed that 'one ADA one vote' was the intended system, and that via transparency the voting system could allow a single individual with one million ADA to be out-voted by the will of a million and one people joining together each with one ADA. And I considered this to be an imperfect but accessible system for everyone. But because the network is not taking the course of 'one ADA one vote' (which I have no problem with, I assume there have been deliberations about this) I feel deeply compelled to highlight how quadratic voting comes up drastically short of what needs to be thought about.\n\nImagining Cardano as a powerful system across the globe that handles money and ostensibly government nation-state voting in the future, bad actors within Cardano will not be small fish among common people blocked by low-level barriers like quadratic voting. A person can easily disperse ADA across wallets to get around quadratic voting, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. And so I find mentions of quadratic voting to be lame, to be beating around the bush, and to be an intellectually dishonest approach. No matter how much you skew the dynamics of the math of relying on ADA for voting, we nevertheless ultimately touch back down on the bedrock of how much ADA people hold. ADA atomized across many wallets to exploit a voting system arrives exactly back at 'one ADA one vote'.\n\nAllow me to paint a picture:\n\nA bad actor encounters quadratic voting, which scales down the influence of tokens in his wallet. Let's imagine he has 1,000,000 ADA.  \n\\> So, the bad actor writes a script to spread his ADA among 100,000 dynamically created wallets, reducing the quadratic effect. Even if he spends a large amount of his ADA to do this, it may be worth the cost of gaining voting leverage for any specific proposal.  \n\\> Cardano security response: Develop the ability to find large dynamic wallet creations and spreading behavior like this.  \n\\> So, the bad actor plans this out to occur over a period of 10 years, moving with sophistication.  \n\\> Cardano security response: Develop a more comprehensive but potentially invasive way to track large-scale spreading of a wallet which ultimately sends out large sums of ADA.  \n\\> So, the bad actor develops further sophisticated ways to spread ADA, first across a few wallets, then gradually more, etc.\n\nThis can go on ad-infinitum, so I won't belabor the steps, but what I end up with is this example: \n\nA bad actor writes a script to, over a long period of time, disperse a huge amount of ADA from many initial wallets to more wallets, then gradually to more wallets over time, in a sophisticated pattern of movement with double-backs, randomized times, and some movements hidden as legit tx (for example paying for shallowly-created NFTs with near-zero production cost), accomplishing a mass dispersal of ADA, playing the long game. Then the bad actor sells this service to nation-states.\n\nIf mass dynamic wallet-creation patterns like this were detectable by Cardano security, a nation state could hire a warehouse of people to pull off this operation manually over time with even greater subterfuge.\n\nAvoiding 'one ADA one vote' is not possible in the face of sophisticated attackers, given any math based on ADA. Only a comprehensive ID system could offer a complete alternative, like Atala PRISM or whatever else comes along. But again (and imagining this at a nation-state level) now we have AI generated identities. IDs would perhaps be an even less reliable system than the kind of geometry-interpretations of ADA movement that could be discovered as sophisticated dispersal patterns.\n\n\"Can't be evil\" is not a realistic tenet for any system humans will use. Evil does not just get stamped out, it will become more sophisticated.\n\nSo long as any voting process on Cardano relies on ADA, there MUST be essential security measures to discover exploitative patterns, upon the time of wallet voting. If we are to utilize quadratic voting, this is some kind of geometry problem and dispersal patterns MUST be developed to take Cardano's growth seriously. To believe in Cardano becoming a global system, we must anticipate that voting exploitation attacks will be severe, precise, patient, and sophisticated at the highest level. Quadratic voting is merely a brick placed on the ground in the path of bad actors, stopping only the most basic users, in the face of what we're believing in. This is not a mature defense strategy.\n\nI don't yet know how to submit a CIP and/or a Governance Proposal, but I would like to submit essentially the following, and at least have these thoughts written in this post:\n\n* For all new voting protocol changes, Cardano must have a dedicated security team to examine and test exploitations.\n* Treasury funds should be allocated to (a) team(s) tasked with developing the voting process into as secure a process as possible. The voting process is the lifeblood of Cardano and we should do the work early of recursively improving voting itself to elevate the system over the longterm.\n* Or, more broadly, Cardano needs a dedicated Red Team to test the implementations of new protocols, with voting protocols as priority. Plus a Blue Team for that matter, or to reliably hire pen-testers from a communally-voted trusted source, or something.\n\nI've heard some brief mentions of a Reputation system, so if anyone can expand on that, I'd be glad to hear. In fact if anyone can educate me on any of this, and assist me in understanding where things are at with voting and where and how this can all be improved, please educate me.\n\nThanks for your time\n\nS", "content_size_bytes": 6283}

Its design introduces pipelining and parallelism into transaction processing — two powerful changes that allow the network to scale.

This shift is not a flaw but an inherent cost of moving from a serialized to a parallel system. It reflects the core trade-off in designing scalable decentralized infrastructure.\n\n[Fee determinism will be a challenge.](https://preview.redd.it/wshwwd2sdo8f1.jpg?width=805&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7d2c254418a7889079530144f5c027a2cee59b73)\n\n\n\n[The resolution of conflicts in pipelines.](https://preview.redd.it/4hfdtxlydo8f1.jpg?width=1413&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=46a3cf4762f025ad71909a232fd4b9b521f2680a)\n\n**Read the article:**\n\n[https://cexplorer.io/article/ouroboros-leios-softens-determinism](https://cexplorer.io/article/ouroboros-leios-softens-determinism)", "content_size_bytes": 1359}

It ranks among the most decentralized blockchains and stands out as the only **top 10** project with **on-chain governance**. Its native assets (CNAs) inherit the same properties as ADA or BTC, meaning they cannot be **frozen or censored** by the protocol.\n\nBut this leads to a difficult and timely question: *In a world where users increasingly choose convenience over principles, does it still make sense to stay this course?*\n\nWe must acknowledge that today's leading ecosystems are often succeeding by prioritizing **speed, low fees, seamless user experience, and high returns**—even at the cost of decentralization. Users have shown a willingness to embrace **centralized Layer 2s and custodial solutions** if it means smoother interactions and better performance.\n\nThe hard truth is that the meaning of \"crypto\" has shifted. It’s no longer solely about decentralization and ideals—it’s increasingly about being part of a **new financial revolution**, and people will go wherever the experience is easiest and most rewarding.\n\nLet’s be clear: **every blockchain is decentralized to some degree**—it’s not a binary feature, but a spectrum. The Cardano community often highlights its top-tier performance on the **Edinburgh Decentralization Index**, and rightfully so. It’s an impressive achievement.\n\nBut here’s the hard truth—**high decentralization alone doesn’t guarantee success**. It’s a crucial pillar, but without strong adoption, liquidity, and user experience, it won’t carry the ecosystem forward on its own. Celebrating decentralization is important—but turning it into real-world impact is the challenge that remains.\n\n**Read the article:**\n\n[https://cexplorer.io/article/can-cardano-succeed-when-the-market-ignores-decentralization](https://cexplorer.io/article/can-cardano-succeed-when-the-market-ignores-decentralization)", "content_size_bytes": 1977}

Then you all burn money on Kaito/CMC logo to become a laughing stock.\n\nNow you turn your chain’s Twitter identity into another NFT project to achieve what effort besides being ridiculed? Just to chase its meme ETF hype? You understand Pudgy will also launch another token called Abstract? Do you understand how extractive it is to have a dual token model? Even the BAYC hadn’t went that low… they stuck with ApeCoin to run their ApeChain.\n\nWhy do you think promoting something so extractive helps your brand - already living close to near extinction?\n\nThis why ppl get irritated with crypto. The higher ups have extremely bad incentive alignment with token holders. They don’t put much thought about their actions’ negative consequences.\n\nIs it because DOT like to dilute its holder base with inflation so they feel something in common with Pudgy, constantly issuing new assets?\n\nEdit 1: If you want to downvote me, at least explain your argument. Pudgy has barely anything to do with Polkadot, besides them launching one game on Mythic chain. Their Abstract Chain uses DA from Celestia and settles on Ethereum. Neither Celestia nor Ethereum official page changed their pfp to a pudgy. It just signals of desperation for any attention for DOT.\n\nEdit 2: For those who don't understand how extractive a future launch of the Abstract token on top of PENGU (Pudgy's meme), here is a nice tidbit from a crypto OG.\n\n>When an ecosystem launch a second token, the sum of both marketcap is eventually always lower than the marketcap of the genesis coin.\n\nSource: [https://x.com/lemiscate/status/1934891292464451612](https://x.com/lemiscate/status/1934891292464451612)", "content_size_bytes": 1963}

For many users, developers, and even entire projects, platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Discord, Telegram, and Reddit serve as their primary connection to the community. In the Polkadot ecosystem, where interoperability, innovation, and openness are celebrated, protecting these social accounts has become a fundamental layer of personal and project-level security.\n\n# Why Social Media Accounts Are a Prime Target\n\nThe Polkadot network is home to hundreds of parachains, tokens, governance proposals, and open-source initiatives. This level of decentralization means users rely heavily on trusted social channels to stay informed. Scammers know this.\n\nHackers target the social media accounts of reputable figures or projects in the Polkadot space for one reason: credibility. By compromising a verified or established account, a scammer can instantly reach thousands of followers who already trust the source. The most common tactics used after hijacking an account include:\n\n* Posting fake DOT giveaways\n* Promoting scam governance proposals\n* Sharing malicious links\n* Advertising fake partnerships or token drops\n* Spreading misinformation to manipulate community voting\n\nIn a blockchain environment where financial decisions often hinge on what’s shared socially, this form of social engineering can be devastating. One compromised account can result in millions of dollars in losses within hours.\n\n# How to Protect Your Accounts and Community\n\n# Enable Strong Authentication\n\n* Use 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication): Prefer app-based options like Google Authenticator or Authy over SMS.\n* Secure your email first: If your email is compromised, your social accounts are next.\n\n# Monitor for Impersonators\n\n* Search your name or project regularly: Look for clone accounts using similar profile pictures and bios.\n* Report fakes immediately: Platforms usually respond quickly to impersonation reports if enough people flag them.  \n\n# Lock Down Admin Permissions\n\n* Limit who can post: On platforms like Discord or Telegram, only trusted admins should be allowed to post announcements.\n* Use bot verification tools: This can reduce spam and protect your server or group from raids.\n\n# Educate Your Audience\n\n* Pin warnings about scams: Especially during big events like parachain auctions or governance periods.\n* Clarify your official channels: Publish a list of legitimate accounts on your project website and keep it up to date.\n\nIn Polkadot, social media doesn’t just support the ecosystem, it helps drive it. It’s where proposals are debated, partnerships are announced, and opportunities are explored. But it’s also where trust can be broken with a single bad post.\n\nWhether you’re a developer managing a parachain, a validator node operator, or simply a passionate community member, protecting your online presence is not optional, it’s mission critical. In Web3, where decentralization removes traditional gatekeepers, your social identity becomes the gate. Keep it locked.\n\nSocials:  \n[\\~X (formerly Twitter)\\~](https://x.com/DotAntiscam) |[ \\~Website\\~](https://polkadot.antiscam.team/) ", "content_size_bytes": 3357}

Liquid staking gives us flexibility and capital efficiency, but it also opens up new risk vectors: smart contract exploits, validator slashing, and even governance attacks.\n\n📉 Just last April (2025), over **$92 million** was lost to DeFi hacks. For DOT holders chasing passive income, these risks aren’t just theoretical.\n\nThat’s where **Bifrost** stands apart.\n\nAs the leading liquid staking protocol in the Polkadot ecosystem, Bifrost isn’t just about maximizing yield—it’s about **defending it**. Here’s what they’re doing differently:\n\n# 🔒 Smart Contract Security + Real-Time Monitoring\n\n* vTokens are secured in **sovereign accounts**—keyless, rule-based structures only governed by OpenGov.\n* Full audits by OAK, CertiK, and SlowMist. Plus internal audits and cross-team code review.\n* If minted/reserved token balances get out of sync, the system **auto-triggers an emergency pause** to protect user funds.\n\nEven in extreme cases (e.g., malicious parachain takeover), DOT unbonding takes 28 days—giving the community time to act.\n\n# 🌐 Decentralized Validator Selection\n\n* Dual system: **Validator White List (VWL)** and **Boost List (VBL)**\n* VWL ranks validators using performance, region, security, slashing history, commission rates, and more.\n* VBL is governed by **public voting**.\n\nThis ensures a healthy, decentralized and dynamic validator set—reducing centralization and correlated risk.\n\n# ⚠️ Slashing Risk? Covered.\n\n* 20% of all vToken commission fees go into a **public insurance fund**\n* 5% of BNC supply is reserved as a protocol-level safety net\n* If slashing happens (rare), the loss is socialized **fairly across vToken holders** only after both funds are exhausted.\n\nTo date, **only 1 slash event** has occurred in 2.5 years—and it was later reversed via governance.\n\n# 💰 1:1 Reserve Backing\n\n* All vDOT is backed **1:1 with DOT**.\n* Even in mass redemptions, the actual **redemption value remains stable**—only swap prices fluctuate.\n\nNo custodians. No black boxes. Just transparent math and autonomous contracts.\n\n# 🗳️ Governance That Actually Works\n\n* All decisions go through **Polkadot’s OpenGov**: full discussion, 14-day voting, and 2-day delay.\n* That’s enough time to catch and stop malicious proposals.\n\nNo centralized control. No rug pulls. Just transparent, community-driven governance.\n\n**TL;DR**  \nBifrost isn't just another liquid staking protocol. It's an intentional defense system wrapped in yield—designed for long-term sustainability, with a proven track record in risk mitigation.\n\nIf you're a DOT holder exploring secure staking strategies, **Bifrost is worth a closer look.**", "content_size_bytes": 2742}

The process can become especially complicated if you were an early adopter who used a variety of exchanges some of which no longer operate today.\n\nAlthough certain banks advertise openness to crypto, most institutions still exercise extreme caution because of regulatory requirements and crypto’s historical links to questionable activity. In reality, the primary challenge often isn’t selling the crypto itself it’s making sure the fiat proceeds are accepted without triggering compliance issues or account freezes.\n\nA few things tend to be absolutely essential to avoid complications:\n\nMaintaining comprehensive records that detail your transaction history and show exactly how your holdings were acquired.\n\nPreparing a clear and traceable audit trail for all wallets, exchanges, and counterparties involved over time.\n\nRecognizing that internal compliance reviews can be far more intensive than many anticipate, sometimes creating friction even when front-line staff seem supportive.\n\nWithout proper preparation, it’s common for people to run into prolonged review periods, repeated demands for documents, or rejections from banks.\n\nOne issue that often gets overlooked is that older wallets sometimes carry an elevated risk rating due to past links with exchanges like BTC-e, Mt. Gox, or Cryptsy. Forensic blockchain tools (for example, Scorechain) can flag this historical exposure as high-risk, even if the funds are entirely legal and verifiable today.\n\nDisclosure: I work in this field (Swiss-regulated financial intermediary) and have helped clients navigate these challenges many times.\n\nI’m curious has anyone else had direct experience moving large holdings into traditional bank accounts?

We just assume we'll be different, we'll be the profitable ones, even though statistically 93-95% of leverage traders lose money.\n\n**Why This Actually Matters:**\n\nThere was some data published recently showing Nolus users hit $1.8M in realized PnL with <5% liquidation rates (on-chain data), and it made me realize how rare it is to see platforms actually share these numbers. Most don't want you to know because the aggregate performance is probably terrible. The truth with Nolus is that it's a platform that earns fees through open positions, and that's why it has features that protect positions from being liquidated during short/long squeezes.\n\nThink about it - traditional platforms (CEXs) often make money when you lose money. Liquidations = their revenue. If 80% of users are losing, that's not a bug, it's a feature for them. Popular decentralized platforms like Hyperliquid (which doesn't directly benefit from liquidations, I think) have traders' PnL of... -$75M! Platforms with good user outcomes will show you the data. Positive aggregate realized PnL, low liquidation rates, verifiable on-chain performance. Platforms that don't talk about this data... well, you can probably guess why.\n\nDo you actually research platform-wide user performance before using leverage protocols? Or do we all just YOLO in assuming we'll beat the odds that everyone else is facing? Because honestly, if a platform can't show me that their users are actually making money collectively, why would I expect to be any different?\n\n**P.S.** Since I mentioned Nolus, there's a campaign live at the moment. By opening a position and getting +10% PnL, you're eligible for a $25 USDC reward. Sorry for no link, but I respect the sub's rules.", "content_size_bytes": 1970}

It’s not just a listing, they’ve already backed TON-native tokens like $DOGS, $BLUM, $NOT, and $MAJOR, and now they’re bringing $TAC into the ecosystem with full wallet support, DeFi tools, and direct dApp access through Bitget Wallet. On top of that, Bitget dropped a $30 million investment into TON earlier this year to drive GameFi and Tap-to-Earn trends, so this isn’t just hype, there’s serious infrastructure and long-term vision behind it. And with the CandyBomb campaign now live (up to 9M $TAC in rewards), it’s a perfect time to get involved whether you’re just exploring or already holding.   \n  \nSeeing this level of alignment between a protocol and an exchange gives me more confidence in TAC protocol's long-term potential, especially in the TON-powered Web3 space that’s really starting to gain traction.  \n  \nAnyone else keeping an eye on it?

The Treasury and IRS struck TD 10021 from existence after Congress passed H.J. Res. 25 in March, which the President signed on April 10, 2025, as Public Law 119-5. The Federal Register notice hitting publication today finalizes the repeal and restores section 6045 regulations to their pre TD 10021 state.\n\nWhy This Rule Mattered in the First Place TD 10021 would have fundamentally altered how DeFi operates by treating decentralized finance front-ends, payment processors, and kiosk operators as \"digital asset middlemen.\" Starting with 2027 transactions, these entities would have been forced to collect customer KYC data and issue the brand new Form 1099-DA reporting gross proceeds on digital-asset sales. Industry groups argued this was both technically unworkable and exceeded the IRS's regulatory mandate, and lawmakers ultimately agreed.\n\nThe death of TD 10021 creates an interesting division in crypto tax reporting, though the IRS can still pursue data through audits or summonses. DeFi front ends and smart contract developers dodge the immediate burden of building KYC systems and backup withholding infrastructure, but they're still on the hook for anti money laundering duties under FinCEN and OFAC. Meanwhile, centralized exchanges and hosted wallets remain firmly in the crosshairs. They must continue preparing to issue Form 1099 DA and collect basis data under TD 10000, maintaining the same timeline: gross proceeds reporting on 2025 trades with basis reporting phasing in during 2026 27. For tax professionals and software developers, this creates a strategic complexity requiring logic splits between 1099 DA ingestion for custodial data and manual entry workflows for DeFi transactions, alongside an ongoing push for better client education about self-reporting obligations.\n\nThe regulatory chess game is far from over. Stablecoin and broader crypto bills moving through Congress could reopen the entire reporting debate, while several states are considering their own digital asset information return rules that could fill the federal gap. Perhaps most significantly, expect the IRS to deploy more summonses and data-analytics audits targeting large, on chain DeFi transactions as a workaround for the missing third party reports.\n\nThis represents a nuanced victory for DeFi innovation, but the underlying tension between regulatory oversight and decentralized finance remains unresolved. The IRS will find other ways to capture this data, and states may step into the void. For now, though, DeFi maintains its operational independence while centralized crypto maintains its path toward traditional financial reporting standards.\n\n Source: [https://awaken.tax/media/article/congress-nixes-defi-broker-rule-1099da-impact](https://awaken.tax/media/article/congress-nixes-defi-broker-rule-1099da-impact)", "content_size_bytes": 2998}

There is a massive shift as these protocols mature into full-blown ecosystems, offering a much richer, more integrated experience. Think of it less like a single tool and more like an entire workshop.\n\nWhat's driving this? Well, the capabilities have exploded. Now, you can deploy your own decentralized applications right within these ecosystems, fostering a new wave of innovation. Staking, for instance, has moved past simply locking tokens for rewards; it’s now deeply tied to securing the network and giving you real governance power, letting you shape the protocol’s future. Even bridging assets across different blockchains, once a confusing and risky endeavor, is becoming remarkably smooth and intuitive, stripping away the complexity that used to deter so many.\n\nThis expansion of utility is fundamentally changing how we interact with decentralized networks. Take Tanssi Network ($TANSSI), for example. Its recent listing on Bitget caught my eye because it’s all about appchain deployment. This focus perfectly aligns with the current trend of infrastructure heavy DeFi projects. While I haven't done a deep dive yet, it clearly signals another step in this broader evolution.

We decided to build it on top of Telegram because it's growing in the crypto space, and has over 1 billion active monthly users.\n\n# ⚙️ How It Works:\n\n* ⛏️ **Tap once a day** to start mining tokens hourly\n* 📉 **Halving system** — early adopters earn more\n* 📲 No battery drain, no mining rigs, no complicated setup\n*  **No token value yet** — we're in **beta**, but early mining gives you future rewards\n\n#  Why It’s Interesting:\n\nUnlike most new projects, this doesn’t ask for upfront money or complicated wallets. It’s a Telegram Mini App — so if you already use Telegram, you’re basically 5 seconds from mining.\n\nWe’re focused on building a community *before* assigning value. The token isn’t tradable yet, but early users will have a big head start once value and utility are introduced.\n\nBot Username: **ZyraNetwork\\_bot**", "content_size_bytes": 1072}

Unlike UMA which relies on optimistic validation (which by its very nature is slow), Ingex uses zk-proofs for validation. This not only results in much faster validation but greater security when nodes are attesting to events.\n\nMuch of the project is open source, and we recently launched our validator dashboard, in anticipation of our Sepolia testnet deployment. The source code is available here:\n\n[https://github.com/IngexZK/validation-dashboard](https://github.com/IngexZK/validation-dashboard)\n\n**We are already in the process of receiving backing from the Optimism Collective (one of the largest layer 2's on Ethereum) and other well-known foundations in the space. Our first major partnership is going to be announced soon.**\n\nAnd rather than just launching an ERC-20 token, we took a novel approach. A small set of ERC-721 tokens (NFTs) will provide passive income for holders each time an event is validated though the Ingex zk-oracle, but also give an allocation of our upcoming ERC-20 token launch.\n\nThere are only two small sets of ERC-721 tokens (and one special token) that have been launched that provide the above benefits. No more sets are launching, so it is subject to availability.\n\nThe first set has already [sold out](https://opensea.io/collection/ingex/overview).\n\nThe second set is available [here](https://opensea.io/collection/ingex-standard-eth/overview).\n\n~~There is also a 1-of-1 special token that provides the most benefits. Only *one* is available to mint. It is available [here](https://opensea.io/collection/ingex-key-contributor).~~ Edit: this has now been sold.\n\nThe three classes of tokens provide passive income at the following rates each time an event is validated through the Ingex zk-oracle:\n\n|Token Set|Revenue Share (Per Token)|Revenue Share (Set Total)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Genesis (sold out)|0.25%|8%|\n|Standard|0.18%|6%|\n|Key Contributor|2.15%|N/A|\n\nAll three provide a substantial allocation of our upcoming ERC-20 token, with the Key Contributor token in particular providing the largest.\n\nThey can can be sold at any time.\n\nHappy to answer any questions about the project here!", "content_size_bytes": 2332}

I’m just looking for honest feedback from people who invest in DeFi - whether you’re a newbie or a pro—before I start spending on marketing for my app.\n\nSo, I built an app that tracks wallets, performs in-depth fundamental analysis, and does deep on-chain analysis of projects. The goal is to help pro users save time and give newbies both knowledge and time when analyzing crypto projects.\n\nWhy did I build it?  \nOver the past year, I developed a standard technique for analyzing projects: gather on-chain data, collect fundamental info (what the project is building, whether there's a real market for it, roadmap, tokenomics, team, social sentiment, etc.). I tried teaching this process a few times, but it was tough - too much info, and nobody really had the time to go through it all.\n\nThen earlier this year, I had an idea: what if I built an app that fetches all the necessary data, feeds it to AI, compares it against my personal benchmarks, and generates a final report that’s easy to understand?  \nSo I did. I created [www.dyorexpert.com](http://www.dyorexpert.com) \\- it's more like an app that helps you to take smart decisions than to make money\n\n(Btw, if you want to test it, you can create a free account with 3 credits—one for wallet tracking, one for fundamental analysis, and one for on-chain analysis.

But is there demand for this?\n\nQuick explanation: imagine a social media like twitter/x where someone well-known in #movies can’t just hijack the conversation in #defi. Even if they have a million followers, their posts in other topics don’t carry extra weight. One vote from a trusted person in #defi carries more weight than 1000 likes from accounts outside that tag.\n\nThat also means bots are useless. Even if you get 1000 fake accounts to like a post, it won’t go viral unless those votes come from people with actual rep in the #topics you're posting into. So it solves fake-news, fake engagement, spam, etc\n\nOriginally, this came from a side project where I was building a decentralized reputation system just to learn more about Rust and smart contracts. I imagined something like a web3 version of Amazon seller ratings — something that can’t be faked or bought.\n\nBut after watching people create tags and vote inside the app, I realized this could actually work as a foundation for a new kind of social media platform.\n\nSo, a few questions for you:\n\n* Do you feel unfairly treated on social media? Like big accounts control all the narrative and your posts are burried beneath spam?\n* Does it bother you when celebrities talk about stuff way outside their expertise?\n* Would you value a feed that’s shaped by people with actual rep in a topic?\n* Do you think fake news and bots are a big enough problem to need a solution like this?\n* What would it take for you to move from Twitter/TikTok to something new?\n\nJust want to have an honest conversation about this. I’m not a VC. I don’t have millions to pour into an app, so the viability of this would depend entirely on the community. So I want to understand what it would actually take for people to support AND USE it. Please be honest, I dont want to waste time building something nobody will ever use.\n\nLet me know what you think, and feel free to ask me anything!\n\nNote: I have a plan to reward creators and to monetize this, but I don’t want the post to get too long. I also have a plan for web3 projects to use the platform to talk about their proejcts, but the platform will be 100% add-free, monetization would come from additional features, private communities, etc. Ask below if you want to hear more about that.\n\nExtra: You can try the reputation tracking demo I was working on here (***this is NOT promotion***, it isn't even an app yet, this is just a link to a playground for people to visually see the algorythm in action):\n\n* [https://rigfr-siaaa-aaaal-ab4fa-cai.icp0.io/tag/ICP](https://rigfr-siaaa-aaaal-ab4fa-cai.icp0.io/tag/ICP) (***this is NOT promotion***, it isn't even an app yet, this is just a link to a playground for people to visually see the algorythm in action, this url will be erased soon)\n\nAttention: The URL looks weird because it’s running fully on-chain, frontend and backend, and I haven't bothered buying a domain for a playground test. It doesn't ask for tokens, doesn't ask to connect with your wallet, and you can explore most pages without signing up, it is just a playground.

I took advantage of the boom in DeFi some years ago and focused on studying random stuff and travelling the world. Went back to DeFi about 1 year ago and got nice returns from it, just using LPs on Uniswap, Aerodrome and...Pancakeswap. Until now.\n\nSince I'm not a complete morron on it, I use multiple wallets and diversify my funds. I never interact with funny stuff too. With that being said, I put a small investment of 1k USD into a pool of ETH/USDC in PCS using the Base blockchain. Kept it running for a while and one day my position had disappeared. At first, I thought it was an Interface issue. Came back to it after 1 hour using a different browser. Still not showing. I went to basescan and my funds were still in the pool, somehow. I was not out of range. The funds were just not showing up. I thought I was just tripping so I went to work like it was just an interface issue.  \n\nAfter 5 hours, same issue. I went to basescan again to see what the heck was going on and try to manually remove my liquidity because I was getting scared. And after 15 / 20 minutes that I decided to remove it manually, my funds were transfered to another wallet. Before that, the hacker/script, collected the fees and transfered it all. Funny thing is, it was like ''i'' did the transfer to this unknown wallet. Like, wtf. \n\n  \nI don't know what I did wrong, it was a brand new wallet that I created just for this pool, never interacted with sketchy stuff. But most important, how does this hack work? Like, I had like more than 300 USDC just sitting in my wallet and it was not stolen. If he had access to my wallet, why not just take it all and leave it completly empty? Is it a script that takes advantage of the smart contract of PCS? Is it a insider of PCS? I'm dumb as fuck? Is the base blockchain shit? All of it? I don't know. If anyone had this issue before, could you enlighten me on this? \n\n  \nIm thinking of buying a different PC just for crypto and using Linux. Maybe that's a start. Don't know if necessary though. I don't want to give up on DeFi, but maybe BTC is the only way. My trust have been shaken.\n\n  \n", "content_size_bytes": 2225}

It allows staking $SOL, $JTO, $BTC, and even stables, and still uses those assets across DeFi via $fragSOL. That part alone makes it feel like a protocol that actually gets the DeFi user mindset.  \n  \nIt didn’t stop at being just another staking tool. It evolved into the FRAG 22 standard, which brings in multi-asset support, better reward distribution, and modular yield strategies. People don’t have to guess where the yield is coming from, it’s more structured and still composable. That’s the kind of clarity I look for when putting assets to work.  \n  \nAnother layer I found is the F Points system. The more you stake and the longer you hold, the more points you earn. That translates into $frag airdrop that will soon be hitting top exchanges like bitget, chances and other rewards. It’s clean and time weighted, something i think i can build a strategy around. There’s even a boost if you’re using something like Backpack wallet with a 1.3x multiplier, which adds flexibility depending on your setup.  \n  \nFor me, it feels like more than just a yield tool. It’s part of a broader shift in DeFi where protocols aren’t just about locking capital. They’re becoming smarter about how value flows while keeping users liquid and active in the ecosystem. It seems to be the kind of movement I want to be early on.", "content_size_bytes": 1643}

Is it user acquisition for their game? Is it to build their community? Or is it just for the TGE price action?\n\nI would say all of these goals have different approaches, but the same frameworks or foundations.\n\nI would definitely start by doing a brand audit of the current position you are at, whether you have launched or are preparing for it. (I provide free brand audits.)\n\nThen assess the main positioning you aim to achieve: a leader in AI agent gaming? A leading infrastructure on Avax prop trading?

Are they the people who are often following KOLs and buying whatever they are shilling? Are they the ones who do research before buying something? Or are they simply web2 users who are looking to join web3?\n\nAll of these have so many different ways to connect, but all in all, you must focus on the foundation of the project itself and then have marketing tactics (not just KOLs or promo posts) - something that can actually stick in the audience's brain. \"JUST DO IT\" - who do you think of, for example?\n\nAnyway, I'm curious if there are any other marketers here who would like to share their methods of doing so.", "content_size_bytes": 1587}

Curious what other builders think about the tradeoffs.\n\nAtomic Coordination Pattern: Biconomy MEE uses this - batch operations into atomic units that either succeed completely or revert entirely. \n\nHandles intent decomposition at execution layer, coordinates state changes across chains through their relayer network.\n\nPros: Clean failure semantics, no partial state issues \n\nCons: Latency from coordination overhead, limited by slowest chain in batch\n\nOptimistic Execution Pattern: More like what Anoma's building - execute operations optimistically, resolve conflicts later through their gossip protocol and fractal scaling.\n\nPros: Better latency, more parallelizable \n\nCons: Complex conflict resolution, harder to reason about finality\n\nMessage Passing + Local Execution: LayerZero/Axelar approach - reliable message delivery, let destination chains handle execution locally.\n\nPros: Simpler security model, leverages existing chain execution \n\nCons: No atomic guarantees, complex error handling across chains\n\nWhat's interesting about the execution environment approach is how they handle intent decomposition. Instead of developers manually orchestrating cross-chain flows, you express high-level intents and the execution layer figures out optimal routing.\n\nBeen looking at Biconomy's implementation - they use a modular architecture where intent processors can plug into their execution environment. So you could have specialized processors for DeFi strategies, NFT operations, governance actions, etc.\n\nThe atomic execution guarantee is compelling for complex operations. Like if you're doing a cross-chain arbitrage that involves 5 steps across 3 chains - either the entire arb succeeds or nothing happens. \n\nNo getting stuck with partial positions.\n\nAnyone else working on execution coordination?

Through its Bitcoin Validated Services (BVS), developers can build dApps secured by BTC holders, with programmable slashing to enforce security. A recent hackathon and early dev traction signal rising adoption.\n\nSatLayer also raised $8M in funding, backed by both crypto VCs and traditional finance, indicating growing institutional interest.

Recently, Mango Network's current listing announcement of its native token $mgo by various top exchanges, including Bitget and Binance, seems to be trending with various views on the project. Mango Network presents itself as a Layer 1 blockchain aiming to tackle fragmentation within Web3 and DeFi by implementing a multi-VM omnichain infrastructure, thereby unifying liquidity and a more seamless and efficient user experience. However, a key question arises: can Mango Network truly deliver on the promise of an integrated, high-performance ecosystem, especially given the complexities and historical security considerations inherent in bridging different virtual machines and maintaining cross-chain integrity?\n\nOne of Mango Network's notable claims is its multi-VM architecture, natively integrating both MoveVM and EVM. This design choice suggests an attempt to harness the security-focused advantages of the Move language, often associated with robust asset management and parallel execution, while retaining compatibility with the vast existing ecosystem of Ethereum-based smart contracts. The stated goal is to eliminate complex bridging protocols and foster cross-chain communication. Yet, the technical intricacies of truly unified state across such diverse virtual machines, ensuring consistent security and performance without introducing new vulnerabilities, warrant close examination.

The program code has already been fully tested locally, and it’s now deployed on Devnet for further testing.\n\nIf you're interested in early access or want to help test the platform when we launch, drop a comment or DM me!\n\nWould really appreciate any and all support! :)\n\nCheers,\n\n**0xBlockBard**", "content_size_bytes": 1972}

I like the way it’s built more for reliability than hype.  \n  \nThen there’s Spark Savings, which lets me turn stablecoins like USDC into yield earning tokens like sUSDC or sUSDS. I’m not feeling like I’m doing anything crazy, just holding and earning a bit over time.  \n  \nIt also secured a listing space on exchanges like bitget as $SPK and a Liquidity Layer that sends unused funds to other protocols so capital doesn’t sit idle. It’s basically trying to make every part of the system more efficient.  \n  \nOne feature that really makes sense is Isolation Mode. It lets them list new tokens with a strict debt ceiling. So if something goes wrong, it won’t affect the rest of the platform. That kind of risk control seems rare.  \n  \nTo me, this feels like a protocol designed to be useful, not just loud.

While SparkLend is built on Sky’s $6.5 billion stablecoin foundation, offering governance-set interest rates and blue-chip collateral like ETH, could it become institutional-grade stability? Unlike Aave’s market-driven rates or Morpho’s peer-to-peer lending, Spark prioritizes predictability, but does this give it an edge over other DeFi protocols?\n\nUnderstandably, $7.3 billion in TVL shows the traction the project is gaining, but its focus on stablecoin lending raises questions about scalability against Aave’s diverse asset pool or Compound’s established user base. One unique feature about this protocol is the Spark Liquidity Layer (SLL), which auto-deploys stablecoin liquidity across Ethereum, Base, and Arbitrum, feeding protocols like Aave and tokenized assets like BlackRock’s BUIDL. This contrasts with Curve’s trading focus or Yearn’s vault strategies, positioning Spark as a cross-chain liquidity hub. But does SLL’s automation truly solve DeFi’s fragmentation, or does its reliance on Sky’s reserves risk centralizing capital? \n\nThe $2.4 billion in RWA integration set it apart, blending CeFi and DeFi more aggressively than Aave or Compound. But can its stablecoin-centric model avoid becoming a walled garden in a composability-driven ecosystem? Morpho Blue’s flexible lending markets highlight Spark’s rigidity, and smart contract risks linger despite robust audits.

Social media, generative AI, and viral algorithms make it virtually free to create and spread information at scale. But verifying that information remains slow, expensive, and subjective.\nIn any environment where the cost of generating claims falls below the cost of verifying them, truth becomes indistinguishable from falsehood.\nThis imbalance has created a runaway crisis of epistemic noise—the uncontrolled proliferation of unverified, contradictory, and often manipulative information.\nThe result isn’t just confusion. It’s fragmentation.\nWithout a shared mechanism for determining what is true, societies fracture into mutually exclusive realities.\nConspiracy and consensus become indistinguishable.\n\n\nDebates devolve into belief wars.\n\n\nPublic health policy falters.\n\n\nMarkets overreact.\n\n\nCommunities polarize.\n\n\nGovernments stall.\n\n\nIndividuals lose trust—not just in institutions, but in each other.\n\n\nWhen we can no longer agree on what is real, we lose our ability to coordinate, plan, or decide. Applications have no standardized, verifiable source of input, and humans have no verifiable source for their beliefs.\nThis is not just a technological problem.\n It is a civilizational one.\n\nProblem 2: Data Overload — Even Truth Is Too Big\nNow imagine we succeed in solving the first problem.\n Suppose we build a working, trustless system that filters signal from noise, verifies claims through adversarial consensus, and rewards people for submitting precise, falsifiable, reality-based statements.\nThen we face a new, equally existential problem:\n📚 Even verified truth is vast.\nA functioning truth engine would still produce a torrent of structured, validated knowledge:\nGeopolitical facts\n\n\nEconomic records\n\n\nScientific results\n\n\nHistorical evidence\n\n\nPhilosophical debates\n\n\nTechnical designs\n\n\nSocial metrics\n\n\nEven when filtered, this growing archive of truth rapidly scales into petabytes.\nThe more data we verify, the more data we have to preserve.\n And if we can’t store it efficiently, we can’t rely on it—or build on it.\nBlockchains and decentralized archives today are wildly inefficient. Most use linear storage models that replicate every byte of every record forever. That’s unsustainable for a platform tasked with recording all of human knowledge, especially moving forward as data creation accelerates.\n🧠 The better we get at knowing the truth, the more expensive it becomes to store that truth—unless we solve the storage problem too.\nSo any serious attempt to solve epistemic noise must also solve data persistence at scale.\n\n🧬 The Helix Solution: A Layered Engine for Truth and Compression\nHelix is a decentralized engine that solves both problems at once.\nIt filters unverified claims through adversarial economic consensus—then compresses the resulting truth into its smallest generative form.\nAt the top layer, Helix verifies truth using open epistemic betting markets.\n\n\nAt the bottom layer, it stores truth using a compression-based proof-of-work model called MiniHelix, which rewards miners not for guessing hashes, but for finding short seeds that regenerate validated data.\n\n\nThis layered design forms a closed epistemic loop:\n❶ Truth is discovered through human judgment, incentivized by markets.\n ❷ Truth is recorded and stored through generative compression.\n ❸ Storage space becomes the constraint—and the currency—of what we choose to preserve.\nHelix does not merely record the truth. It distills it, prunes it, and preserves it as compact generative seeds—forever accessible, verifiable, and trustless.\nWhat emerges is something far more powerful than a blockchain:\n🧠 A global epistemic archive—filtered by markets, compressed by computation, and shaped by consensus.\n\nHelix is the first decentralized engine that pays people to discover the truth about reality, verify it, compress it, and record it forever in sub-terabyte form. Additionally, because token issuance is tied to its compressive mining algorithm, the value of the currency is tied to the physical cost of digital storage space and the epistemic effort expended in verifying its record.\nIt works like crowd-sourced intelligence analysis, where users act as autonomous evaluators of specific claims, betting on what will ultimately be judged true. Over time, the platform generates a game-theoretically filtered record of knowledge—something like Wikipedia, but with a consensus mechanism and confidence metric attached to every claim. Instead of centralized editors or reputation-weighted scores, Helix relies on distributed economic incentives and adversarial consensus to filter what gets recorded.\nEach claim posted on Helix becomes a speculative financial opportunity: a contract that opens to public betting. A user can bet True/False/Analigned, and True/False tallies are added up during the betting period, the winner being determined as the side that had the greatest amount of money bet on it. Unaligned funds go to whoever the winner is, to incentivize an answer, any answer. This market-based process incentivizes precise wording, accurate sourcing, and strategic timing. It creates a new epistemic economy where value flows to those who make relevant, verifiable claims and back them with capital. Falsehoods are penalized; clarity, logic, and debate are rewarded.\nIn doing so, Helix solves a foundational problem in open information systems: the unchecked proliferation of noise. The modern age has provided labor-saving tools for the production of information, which has driven the cost of making false claims to effectively zero. In any environment where the cost of generating claims falls below the cost of verifying them, truth becomes indistinguishable from falsehood. Paradoxically, though we live in the age of myriad sources of decentralized data, in the absence of reliable verification heuristics, people have become more reliant on authority or “trusted” sources, and more disconnected or atomized in their opinions. Helix reverses that imbalance—economically.\n\nGenerative Compression as Consensus\nUnderneath the knowledge discovery layer, Helix introduces a radically new form of blockchain consensus, built on compression instead of raw hashing. MiniHelix doesn’t guess hashes like SHA256. It tests whether a short binary seed can regenerate a target block.\nThe goal isn’t just verification—it’s compression. The miners test random number generator seeds until they find one that produces the target data when fed back into the generator. A seed can replace a larger block if it produces identical output. The fact that it’s hard to find a smaller seed that generates the target data, just like its hard to find a small enough hash value (eg. Bitcoin PoW) that can be computed FROM the target data, ensures that Minihelix will preserve all the decentralized security features of Proof-of-Work blockchains, but with several additional key features.\nUnlike Bitcoin, the target data is not fed into the hash algorithm along with a number from a counter hoping to find a qualifying hash output, making each submission unique and only usable in that one comparison, instead we are testing random seeds and comparing the output to see if it generates the target block. This subtle shift allows miners to not just check the “current” block but check that output against all current (and past!) blocks, finding the most compact encodings of truth. \nBecause the transaction data that must be preserved is the OUTPUT of the function (instead of the input, as in Bitcoin PoW), the miner hashes only the output to ensure fidelity. This means the blockchain structure can change—but the data it encodes cannot. Helix mines all blocks in parallel for greater compression, even blocks that have been mined already. Because the same seed can be tested across many blocks simultaneously, MiniHelix enables miners to compress all preexisting blocks in parallel.\nMinihelix compresses new (unmined) blocks as well as old (mined) blocks at the same time, if it ever finds a seed that generates an entire block (new or old), it submits for that seed to replace the old block and is payed out for the difference in storage savings.\nHelix gets smaller, the seedchain structure changes, the underlying blockchain that it generates stays the same. Security+efficiency=Helix.\nHelix compresses itself, mines all blocks at once, and can replace earlier blocks with smaller ones that output the same data. The longer the chain is, the more opportunity there is for some part of it to be compressed with a smaller generative seed. Those seeds could then be compressed as well with the same algorithm, leading to persistent and compounding storage gains. This is always being challenged by additional data-load from new statements, but as we’ve covered, that only increases the opportunities for miner’s compression. The bigger it gets, the smaller it gets, so there’s eventually an equilibrium. This leads to a radical theoretical result: Helix has a maximum data storage overhead; the storage increases from new statements start to decelerate around 500 gigabytes. The network can’t add blocks without presenting proof of achieving storage gains through generative proof-of-work, which becomes easier the longer the chain becomes. Eventually the system begins to shrink as fast as it grows and reaches an equilibrium state, as the data becomes nested deeper within the recursive algorithm.\n- The block content is defined by its output (post-unpacking), not its seed.\n\n\n- The hash is computed after unpacking, meaning two different seeds generating the same output are equivalent.\n\n\n- Only smaller seeds are rewarded or considered “improvements”; much more likely the longer the chain gets, so a compression/expansion equilibrium is eventually reached.\n\n\nAs a result, the entire Helix blockchain will never exceed 1 terabyte of hard drive space.\n\nTie-breaking rule for multiple valid seeds:\n\n\nWhen two valid generative seeds for the same output exist, pick:\n\n\nThe shorter one.\n\n\nOr if equal in length, the lexicographically smaller one.\n\n\nThis gives deterministic, universal resolution with no fork.\n\n\nReplacement protocol:\n\n\nNodes validate a candidate seed:\n\n\nRun the unpack function on it.\n\n\nHash the result.\n\n\nIf it matches an existing block and the seed is smaller: accept & replace.\n\n\nSeedchain shortens, blockchain height is unaffected because output is preserved.\n\n\n\nThe outcome is a consensus mechanism that doesn’t just secure the chain—it compresses it. Every mined block is proof that a smaller, generative representation has been found. Every compression cycle builds on the last. And every layer converges toward the Kolmogorov limit: the smallest possible representation of the truth.\n\nFrom Currency to Epistemology\nHelix extends Bitcoin’s logic of removing “trusted” epistemic gatekeepers from the financial record to records about anything else. Where Bitcoin decentralized the ledger of monetary transactions, Helix decentralizes the ledger of human knowledge. It treats financial recording and prediction markets as mere subsections of a broader domain: decentralized knowledge verification. While blockchains have proven they can reach consensus about who owns what, no platform until now has extended that approach to the consensual gathering, vetting, and compression of generalized information.\nHelix is that platform.\nIf Bitcoin and Ethereum can use proof-of-work and proof-of-stake to come to consensus about transactions and agreements, why can’t an analogous mechanism be used to come to consensus about everything else?\n\nTokenomics & Incentive Model\nHelix introduces a native token—HLX—as the economic engine behind truth discovery, verification, and compression. But unlike platforms that mint tokens based on arbitrary usage metrics, Helix ties issuance directly to verifiable compression work and network activity.\n🔹 Compression-Pegged Issuance\n1 HLX is minted per gigabyte of verified storage compression. If a miner finds a smaller seed that regenerates a block’s output, they earn HLX proportional to the space saved (e.g., 10 KB = 0.00001 HLX). Rewards are issued only if:\nThe seed regenerates identical output\n\n\nIt is smaller than the previous one\n\n\nNo smaller valid seed exists\n\n\nThis ties HLX to the cost of real-world storage. If HLX dips below the price of storing 1 GB, mining becomes unprofitable, supply slows, and scarcity increases—automatically.\nHelix includes no admin keys to pause, override, or inflate token supply. All HLX issuance is governed entirely by the results of verifiable compression and the immutable logic of the MiniHelix algorithm. No authority can interfere with or dilute the value of HLX.\n🔹 Value Through Participation\nWhile rewards are tied to compression, statement activity creates compression opportunities. Every user-submitted statement is split into microblocks and added to the chain, expanding the search space for compression. Since the chain is atomized into blocks that are mined in parallel, a longer chain means more compression targets and more chances for reward. This means coin issuance is indirectly but naturally tied to platform usage.\nIn this way:\nUsers drive network activity and contribute raw data.\n\n\nMiners compete to find the most efficient generative encodings of that data.\n\n\nThe network collectively filters, verifies, and shrinks its own record.\n\n\nThus, rewards scale with both verifiable compression work and user participation. The more statements are made, the more microblocks there are to mine, the more HLX are issued. So issuance should be loosely tied to, and keep up with, network usage and expansion.\n🔹 Long-Term Scarcity\nAs the network matures and more truths are recorded, the rate of previously unrecorded discoveries slows. Persistent and universally known facts get mined early. Over time:\nNew statement activity levels off.\n\n\nCompression targets become harder to improve.\n\n\nHLX issuance declines.\n\n\nThis creates a deflationary curve driven by epistemic saturation, not arbitrary halvings. Token scarcity is achieved not through artificial caps, but through the natural exhaustion of discoverable, verifiable, and compressible information.\n\nCore System Architecture\nHelix operates through a layered process of input, verification, and compression:\n1. Data Input and Microblock Formation\nEvery piece of information submitted to Helix—whether a statement or a transfer—is broken into microblocks, which are the atomic units of the chain. These microblocks become the universal mining queue for the network and are mined in parallel.\n2. Verification via Open Betting Markets\nIf the input was a statement, it is verified through open betting markets, where users stake HLX on its eventual truth or falsehood. This process creates decentralized consensus through financial incentives, rewarding accurate judgments and penalizing noise or manipulation.\n3. Compression and Mining: MiniHelix Proof-of-Work\nAll valid blocks—statements, transfers, and metadata—are treated as compression targets. Miners use the MiniHelix algorithm to test whether a small binary seed can regenerate the data. The system verifies fidelity by hashing the output, not the seed, which allows the underlying structure to change while preserving informational integrity.\nMicroblocks are mined in parallel across the network.\n\n\nCompression rewards are issued proportionally: 1 HLX per gigabyte of verified storage savings.\n\n\nThe protocol supports block replacement: any miner who finds a smaller seed that regenerates an earlier block may replace that block without altering the informational record.\n\n\nIn practice, newly submitted microblocks are the easiest and most profitable compression targets.\n\n\nHowever, the architecture allows that at the same time if a tested seed also compresses a previous block more efficiently, they may submit it as a valid replacement and receive a reward, with no impact to data fidelity.\n\n\nGovernance & Consensus\nHelix has no admin keys, upgrade authority, or privileged actors. The protocol evolves through voluntary client updates and compression improvements adopted by the network.\nAll valid data—statements, transfers, and metadata—is split into microblocks and mined in parallel for compression. Miners may also submit smaller versions of prior blocks for replacement, preserving informational content while shrinking the chain.\nConsensus is enforced by hashing the output of each verified block, not its structure. This allows Helix to compress and restructure itself indefinitely without compromising data fidelity.\nToward Predictive Intelligence: Helix as a Bayesian Inference Engine\nHelix was built to filter signal from noise—to separate what is true from what is merely said. But once you have a system that can reliably judge what’s true, and once that truth is recorded in a verifiable archive, something remarkable becomes possible: the emergence of reliable probabilistic foresight.\nThis is not science fiction—it’s Bayesian inference, a well-established framework for updating belief in light of new evidence. Until now, it has always depended on assumptions or hand-picked datasets. But with Helix and decentralized prediction markets, we now have the ability to automate belief updates, at scale, using verified priors and real-time likelihoods.\nWhat emerges is not just a tool for filtering information—but a living, decentralized prediction engine capable of modeling future outcomes more accurately than any centralized institution or algorithm that came before it.\n\n📈 Helix + Prediction Markets = Raw Bayesian Prediction Engine\nBayesian probability gives us a simple, elegant way to update belief:\nP(H∣E)=(P(E∣H)⋅P(H))\\P(E) \nWhere:\nP(H) = Prior estimated likelihood of (H)\nP(E∣H) = Likelihood (H) if (E) is true\n\n\nP(E) = Probability of (E) \n\n\nP(H∣E)= Updated belief in the hypothesis after seeing the evidence\n\n\n\n🧠 How This Maps to Helix and Prediction Markets\nThis equation can now be powered by live, verifiable data streams:\nBayesian Term\nProvided by\nP(H)\nThe Stats: Belief aggregates obtained from Prediction market statistics and betting activity.\nP(E)\nThe Facts: Helix provides market-implied odds given current information of proven facts.\nE\nHelix: the evidence — resolved outcomes that feed back into future priors to optimize prediction accuracy over time.\n\nEach part of the formula now has a reliable source — something that’s never existed before at this scale.\n\n🔁 A Closed Loop for Truth\nHelix provides priors from adversarially verified statements.\n\n\nPrediction markets provide live likelihoods based on economic consensus.\n\n\nHelix resolves events, closing the loop and generating new priors from real-world outcomes.\n\n\nThe result is a decentralized, continuously learning inference algorithm — a raw probability engine that updates itself, forever.\n\n🔍 Why This Wasn’t Possible Before\nThe power of Bayesian inference depends entirely on the quality of the data it receives. But until now, no large-scale data source could be trusted as a foundational input. Traditional big data sets:\nAre noisy, biased, and unaudited\n\n\nGrow more error-prone as they scale\n\n\nCan’t be used directly for probabilistic truth inference\n\n\nHelix breaks this limitation by tying data validation to open adversarial consensus, and prediction markets sharpen it with real-time updates. Together, they transform messy global knowledge into structured probability inputs.\nThis gives us a new kind of system:\nA self-correcting, crowd-verified Bayesian engine — built not on top-down labels or curated datasets, but on decentralized judgment and economic truth pressure.\n\nThis could be used both ways,\n➤ \"How likely is H, given that E was observed?\"\nYou’ll want:\n\n\nP(H) from Helix (past priors)\n\n\nP(E∣H) from prediction markets\n\n\nP(E)) from Helix (did the evidence occur?)\n\n\nBut if you're instead asking:\n➤ \"What’s the likelihood of E, given belief in H?\"\nThen prediction markets might give you P(H) and give you the probability of something that’s been decided as 100% on Helix already,\nSo you could use data outside Helix to infer truth and plausibility of statements on Helix, and you could use statements on Helix to make predictions of events in the real world. Either way, the automation and interoperability of a Helix-based inference engine would maximize speculative investment earnings on prediction markets and other platforms, but also in the process refine and optimize any logical operations we do involving the prediction of future events. This section is just to provide an example of how this database could be used for novel applications once it’s active, Helix is designed as an epistemic backbone, so be as simple and featureless as possible, specifically to allow the widest area of exploration in incorporating the core functionality into new ideas and applications. Helix records everything real and doesn’t get too big, that’s a nontrivial accomplishment if it works.\n\nClosing Statement\nToday smart contracts only execute correctly if they receive accurate, up‑to‑date data. Today, most dApps rely on centralized or semi‑centralized oracles—private APIs, paid data feeds, or company‑owned servers. This introduces several critical vulnerabilities: Variable Security Footprints: Each oracle’s backend has its own closed‑source security model, which we cannot independently audit. If that oracle is compromised or manipulated, attackers can inject false data and trigger fraudulent contract executions.\nThis means that besides its obvious epistemic value as a truth-verification engine, Helix solves a longstanding problem in blockchain architecture: the current Web3 ecosystem is decentralized, but its connection to real-world truth has always been mediated through centralized oracles like websites, which undermine the guarantees of decentralized systems. Helix replaces that dependency with a permissionless, incentive-driven mechanism for recording and evaluating truth claims that introduces a decentralized connection layer between blockchain and physical reality—one that allows smart contracts to evaluate subjective, qualitative, and contextual information through incentivized public consensus, not corporate APIs. Blockchain developers can safely use Helix statements as a payout indicator in smart-contracts, and that information will always be reliable, up-to-date, and standardized.\nThis marks a turning point in the development of decentralized applications: the spontaneous establishment of a trustless oracle which enables the blockchain to finally see, interpret, and interact with the real world, on terms that are open, adversarially robust, and economically sound. Anyone paying attention to news and global zeitgeist will discern the obvious necessity of a novel method to bring more commonality into our opinions and philosophy. \nHelix is more than code—it’s a societal autocorrect for issues we’ve seen arising from a deluge of information, true and dubious. Where information flows are broken, Helix repairs. Where power distorts, Helix flattens. It seeks to build a trustless, transparent oracle layer that not only secures Web3 but also strengthens the foundations of knowledge in an era of misinformation. We have developed tools to record and generate data, while our tools for parsing that data are far behind. AI and data analysis can only take us so far when the data is so large and occluded, we must now organize ourselves. \nHelix is a complex algorithm that’s meant only to analyze and record the collectively judged believability of claims. Correctly estimating how generally believable a claim is utilizes the peerless processing power of the human brain in assessing novel claims. As it is currently the most efficient hardware in the known universe for doing so, any attempt at analyzing all human knowledge without it would be a misallocation of energy on a planetary scale. \nInformation≠Data. \nData has become our enemy, but our most reliable path to information. We must find a path through the data. Without it we are lost, adrift in a sea of chaos.\nLike the DNA from which it takes its name, Helix marks a profound paradigm shift in the history of our evolution, and carries forth the essential nature of everything we are.\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Reference\nWhat follows is a formal description of the core Helix mechanics: seed search space, probabilistic feasibility, block replacement, and compression equilibrium logic. These sections are written to support implementers, researchers, and anyone seeking to validate the protocol’s claims from first principles.\n\nIf L_S == L_D, the block is validated but unrewarded. It becomes part of the permanent chain, and remains eligible for future compression (i.e. block replacement).\nThis ensures that all blocks can eventually close out while maintaining incentive alignment toward compression. Seeds longer than the block are never accepted.\n\n2. Search Space and Compression Efficiency\nLet:\nB = number of bytes in target data block\n\n\nN = 2^(8 × L_S) = number of possible seeds of length L_S bytes\n\n\nAssume ideal generative function is surjective over space of outputs of length B bytes\n\n\nProbability that a random seed S of length L_S compresses a B-byte block:\nP_{\\text{success}}(L_S, B) = \\frac{1}{2^{8B}} \\quad \\text{(uniform success probability)}\nTo find a compressive seed of length L_S < B, the expected number of attempts is:\nE = \\frac{2^{8B}}{2^{8L_S}} = 2^{8(B - L_S)}\nImplications:\nShorter L_S = exponentially harder to find\n\n\nThe longer the chain (more blocks in parallel), the higher the chance of finding at least one compressive seed\n\n\nEqual-length seeds are common and act as safe fallback validators to close out blocks\n\n\n\n3. Block Replacement Logic (Pseudocode)\nfor each candidate seed S:\n    output = G(S)\n    for each target block D in microblock queue or chain:\n        if output == D:\n            if len(S) < len(D):\n                // Valid compression\n                reward = (len(D) - len(S)) bytes\n                replace_block(D, S)\n                issue_reward(reward)\n            else if len(S) == len(D):\n                // Valid, but not compression\n                if D not yet on chain:\n                    accept_block(D, S)\n                    // No reward\n            else:\n                // Larger-than-block seed: reject\n                continue\n\n\nMiners scan across all target blocks\n\n\nReplacements are permitted for both unconfirmed and confirmed blocks\n\n\nEqual-size regeneration is a no-op for compression, but counts for block validation\n\n\n\n4. Compression Saturation and Fallback Dynamics\nIf a block D remains unmined after a large number of surrounding blocks have been compressed, it may be flagged as stubborn or incompressible.\nLet:\nK = total number of microblocks successfully compressed since D entered the queue\n\n\nIf K > T(D), where T(D) is a threshold tied to block size B and acceptable confidence (e.g. 99.999999% incompressibility), then:\nThe block is declared stubborn\n\n\nIt is accepted at equal-size seed, if one exists\n\n\nOtherwise, it is re-bundled with adjacent stubborn blocks into a new unit\n\n\nOptional: reward miners for proving stubbornness (anti-compression jackpots)\n\n\nThis fallback mechanism ensures that no block remains indefinitely in limbo and allows the protocol to dynamically adjust bundling size without hard rules.\n\n", "content_size_bytes": 27859}

This introduces token-based participation in the Spark protocol, giving users the ability to join governance processes and earn rewards through SPK staking.\n\nSpark was launched in 2023 and has since become one of the leading DeFi protocols. It currently holds over $8 billion in TVL, with $3.8 billion in total borrowing and lending activity, and $186 million paid out in yield to users. \n\nSPK is designed to serve multiple purposes:\n\n* It allows holders to vote on future governance proposals.\n* It can be staked to earn Spark Points.\n* In the future, staked SPK may also help secure the protocol.\n\nA total of 10 billion SPK tokens have been created. These will be distributed gradually over 10 years, based on the rules outlined in the Spark Artifact.\n\n# Distribution Breakdown\n\n**1. Sky (65%) – 6.5 billion SPK**  \nThese tokens are reserved for users and will be distributed through a farming system called Sky. The release schedule is:\n\n* Years 1–2: 1.625 billion SPK per year\n* Years 3–4: 812.5 million per year\n* Years 5–6: 406.25 million per year\n* Years 7–10: 203.13 million per year\n\nSky farms are not yet live.\n\n**2. Ecosystem (23%) – 2.3 billion SPK**  \nThis portion is meant to support the growth of the Spark ecosystem. Seventeen percent is available at the time of token launch. The rest will unlock after one year. Some of this allocation is being used for the Ignition Airdrop.\n\n**3. Contributors (12%) – 1.2 billion SPK**  \nThese tokens are allocated to the core contributors behind Spark. The vesting schedule includes a one-year lockup (cliff), followed by a gradual release over the next three years.\n\n**Ignition Airdrop**\n\nThe Ignition Airdrop is now live. Eligible users can claim their tokens until July 22 at 2 PM UTC. Once claimed, SPK can also be staked using Overdrive to earn additional rewards.", "content_size_bytes": 1931}

I want to be transparent and show you my trades in real time. That means, you’re going to see when i’m right and when i’m wrong.

AI monetization is no longer in the proof of concept phase. ARR grew 39% YoY, and AI components are now in all major contracts. I ran this through a probability analysis to come to an expected value of 26% for a 12-month hold.\n\nSo why did I buy it now? Why not a couple of weeks ago or after last earnings. This is the part of the trade that adds another level of differentiation to my strategy. I believe that their are two valuations that need to be considered. One is the fundamental one, that is what I discussed above, but second is the technical one. I prefer to buy a stock when it is fundamentally solid, but technically in a pull back. This keeps me from buying tops.\n\nI do not buy every stock just because it has a major pull back. It must pass a strict framework I have built to called the Pearl Framework. Then on the pullback (I check this on the daily chart) I make sure the sell off was not earned. In the case of NICE, I could find no fundamental reason for the sell off.\n\nLastly I waited for strength to return. Finally after hours of trading sideways on the 30m chart the RSI Lagueere crossed above the FE line which is a bullish indicator. I prefer it to be on the hourly chart but I accepted the partial confirmation\n\nMy aim for this note was to give you a little insight into why I choose what to buy, and why I choose when to buy.\n\n  \n\\*\\*\\*A quick note, this stock was below the 50sma and 200 sma which causes me to position smaller than usual. The reason is the 50sma and 200 sma are good trend identifiers.

This upward momentum comes as market participants respond to multiple positive economic signals across North American and global markets.\n\nThe Canadian equity benchmark had previously closed higher on Tuesday, with a 0.27% gain that positioned it favorably for continued upward movement. Market analysts note that this potential consecutive day of gains could help establish a more sustained bullish trend after recent volatility.\n\nInvestor sentiment appears particularly responsive to indications that trade concerns, which had recently weighed on global markets, may be moderating. This shift in trade dynamics has created a more favorable environment for risk assets, including equities.\n\nU.S. Employment Data Exceeds Expectations\nA significant factor driving the positive outlook is the latest data from the United States labor market. The U.S. private payrolls report showed employers added 143,000 jobs in October, substantially surpassing economist expectations of 110,000 positions.\n\nThis employment strength offers reassurance about the resilience of the North American economy, potentially indicating that economic growth remains robust despite recent concerns about a slowdown. Given the close economic ties between Canada and the United States, positive U.S. economic data typically has favorable implications for Canadian markets.\n\nThe employment figures also come ahead of the highly anticipated U.S. Federal Reserve policy announcement scheduled for later in the day, which will be closely examined for signals about future interest rate trajectories.\n\nCommodities Show Mixed Performance\nIn the commodities sector, which heavily influences the resource-rich Canadian market, performance was mixed. Gold futures showed a slight decline of 0.2%, retreating from recent record highs as risk sentiment improved and investors reduced holdings in traditional safe-haven assets.\n\nOil prices, however, demonstrated strength with U.S. crude prices rising 1.2% while Brent crude added 1.1%. This uptick in energy prices potentially benefits Canada’s substantial oil sector, which represents a significant component of the Toronto market index.\n\nCopper prices also saw positive movement, gaining 0.4% as industrial metal demand prospects improved alongside the more optimistic economic outlook. The base metal often serves as a barometer for global economic health due to its widespread use across multiple industries.\n\nCorporate Developments and Market Dynamics\nOn the corporate front, Cameco Corp announced it had secured preliminary approval from the Japanese government for a stake in Kazatomprom, the world’s largest uranium producer. This strategic development could potentially influence the nuclear fuel sector and Cameco’s market position.\n\nMeanwhile, Precision Drilling reported quarterly results that revealed its third-quarter profit had been halved compared to the previous year. The company cited reduced drilling activity as the primary factor behind the earnings decline.\n\nIn the financial sector, major Canadian banks showed pre-market stability, potentially benefiting from improved economic sentiment and the prospect of a less aggressive interest rate reduction cycle, which could protect net interest margins.\n\n", "content_size_bytes": 3967}

Don’t trade. Don’t trade to make money no matter how much you need it. Don’t trade to make money no matter how broke you are. Don’t trade to make money even if you learned a thing or two. Master the market. There’s no other way to go about it. I focus a lot on psychology but that comes only when you have mastered either technicals or fundamentals to a point where you can use it to make money in the market. Trading is probabilities which everyone knows but so is every single business decision that’s taken on earth is just that those decisions take time to be seen as results and not sudden - except in trading, the results are immediate but so are the profits, so are the losses. \n\nFocus on learning. Focus on mastering. Focus on knowing the market to a level where when you look at the charts you know exactly what’s going on and you just need to find a trade. You cannot make money otherwise. Trading is probabilities right? Now, it is up to a trader to have the best chances on his side and for every single factor that you miss by not knowing - you lower your chance of making money on that trade and overall - trading. \n\nSo, the way trading actually works is finding all the factors that give the best probability in the market and mastering them. Key levels. Momentum. Price rejections. Liquidity grab. Market structure. Swap zones. SnD zones. About 7-9 different factors at play and master every single one of them. Then - trade the market only when you have 3-5 or more factors that’s on the side of your trade (sort of like confluence in a trade) so that you have the highest probability in each trade - and what happens? You’re profitable. It’s that simple and that hard to do. \n\nFocus on learning. Learning about yourself. Learning about the market. Don’t trade for money. It’s knowledge in the market and emotional regulation and a very different / sincere thought process that makes money in this game. It isn’t a business where people come together to make it happen - it’s a profession where you are the one who makes it happen hence you are somewhat the product that does “sales”. \n\nThe better you are, the better the results. The better the results, the more time you have to improve every aspect of trading and yourself. Make loads of money. Lose a little. Make even more. Continue to learn. Master yourself along the way.

If you’ve been trading for any amount of time, I’m willing to bet you know exactly what I mean.\n\nYour setup appears. All the boxes are checked. But now you're stuck — trying to calculate position size. By the time you’ve figured it out, the move’s already gone.\n\nThat’s when I discovered the **Average True Range (ATR)**.\n\nATR does exactly what it sounds like: it measures the **average true range** of a stock — a clean, effective proxy for volatility.\n\nLet me give you two extremes:\n\n* **$AXON** has an ATR of **29.75**\n* **$SPY** has an ATR of **4.49**\n\nBoth trade at similar price levels, but AXON is about **6x more volatile**. That matters.\n\nWhy? Because a volatile stock needs **room to breathe**.\n\nLet’s say you use a $10 stop loss. That might work fine on SPY, but on AXON, it’ll likely get hit quickly — not because your setup was wrong, but because the stop didn’t match the volatility. So even if you’re risking the same 1% on a $100K account, **you’d get stopped out \\~6x faster** on AXON, on average.\n\nBut here’s where it gets interesting:  \nIf I size my stop **based on ATR** — let’s say **1.5x ATR** — I give my trade room to work **regardless of the ticker**. Now, all I need to figure out is how many shares to buy.\n\nHere’s the formula I use:\n\n    Shares = (Account Size × Risk %) / (ATR × Multiplier)\n\nExample:  \nYou have a $100K account, willing to risk 1% ($1,000), and XYZ has an ATR of $10.\n\nIf you use a 1.5x ATR stop:\n\n    Shares = 1,000 / (1.5 × 10) = 1,000 / 15 ≈ 66 shares\n\nYou’d buy 66 shares and set a $15 stop loss. Now the position is tuned to the stock’s volatility.\n\nI personally use **ThinkorSwim**, and I’ve coded a simple script that adds a label on my charts showing me the exact share count to buy.

I was a BE member for a year. I originally joined to learn how to trade, but they really push you to focus on the “business” side of things (aka recruiting people for commissions). I didn’t know anything about this industry, so unfortunately, I fell for it.\nThis post isn’t meant to hate on any members of the company, but y’all really need to wake up and face the truth. It IS a pyramid scheme. We can’t ignore the fact that the company thrives on recruiting people. It’s a hard pill to swallow because we’ve been conditioned and brainwashed for years to think we’re doing God’s work by offering people this “life-changing, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.”\nBut let’s be real, once I got into the “business side,” I started seeing people as potential recruits to help me rank up. We were taught to believe we were helping them, so we shouldn’t feel bad about it. As a Christian, I really believed I was doing God’s work and that’s what makes it even sadder. I was all in. I did everything my “coaches” told me to do, including paying out of pocket to attend conventions.\nAfter going to one of those conventions (basically listening to motivational speakers tell us to never stop dreaming; aka never stop recruiting), I started to feel like something was seriously off. They straight up admitted they didn’t care about trading or even understand how it works, because all the focus was on recruitment, cause that’s where the “real money” is. I instantly felt sick to my stomach.\nI’ll admit, I should’ve done my own research before joining, but they tell you not to look them up on Google because all you’ll find is negativity and people calling it a pyramid scheme. Major red flag. But I was young and naive, so I didn’t.\nTo anyone still in the company recruiting day and night, GET OUT WHILE YOU CAN. It’s so ironic how they preach about having work-life balance and “never have to clock in and out” when in reality, they’re working 24/7. The brainwashing in these MLMs is intense. They make you feel like it’s your fault if you don’t succeed.\nI still believe MLM members are victims too, and the evil ones are the ones on top of the pyramid.

I jumped from indicators to price action, to ICT, to SMC, to trend lines, thinking the next system would finally unlock it. But here’s the truth:\n\nIt was never about the strategy.\n\nIt was about how I executed it.\n\nOnce I stopped trying to guess market direction and started reacting to what’s in front of me, things changed.

As for Ger40 we started off the week with a strong move with a strong break and close above ATH’s on Wednesday. Thursday + Friday we had a slight pullback to retest the previous ATH range. Switching over to US100 we traded in a < 1.5% range; nothing to write home about. It’s important to note that both these indices are continuing to hold their 9dma - meaning shorter term path of least resistance continues to be higher. \n\n**Going Into Next Week**\n\nLooking into the week ahead, here’s a couple things I will be keeping in the back of my mind.\n\n* Trump has imposed 30% tariffs on the EU and Mexico effective on Aug 1st. This, at the point of writing this, has caused a -0.77% drop on Ger40 and a -0.43% drop on US100 as well; meaning both will be opening up below their 9dma’s. \n* This week is a heavy red folder week for the US with vast economic events. Including CPI on Tuesday, PPI Wednesday, Unemployment, Retail and Core Retail all on Thursday. Not making it easy to trade. \n\n\n\n**My playbook for the week ahead**\n\nAs for US100 - I am not bearish whatsoever, we are still above all daily ma’s so path of least resistance is higher. Despite this, I know momentum is slowing, to learn out why; we teach all things momentum within the community. As always; I’ll not be looking to catch any counter-trend trades - momentum is everything. Why would you try and time the market? Position yourself to profit, that is it. Making yourself available to the market is what we teach, not trying to force scenarios. If price is to close below the 9dma (or open below) - I expect price to head towards the 21dma. That is my next immediate support noted, with the previous ATH range below that. On a smaller timeframe - my advice is all eyes on this consolidation. If you know, you know. The box system is one to use. \n\n\n\nGer40 is somewhat different. Judging by the weekend markets we will be opening up below the 9dma and our previous ATH range which should be now acting as support. This is less bullish than what we see with US100. With Ger40 opening up below this support, the law of averages suggests that we will then head down towards the next zone around €23,475. From this I can see some rangebound action on the cards. Unless by some miraculous pre-market action Monday morning that recovers the previous ATH’s and this is the retest before the next move higher. \n\n  \n", "content_size_bytes": 2504}

I know how the market works sometimes but sometimes I still dont get it. I hope you guys can help me start.

Thanks guys.\n\n\nEdit: plz up vote this i know there are lots of people in my situation that are In need of this info. I appreciate you guys very much 🙏.\n\nEdit #2: thanks for the tip guys, but I still have some questions. I heard that you should focus on one market and one strategy and improve upon it. What does it mean by one market like 1 stock? And I still dont get how people put $100 in and make like 1500 in day trading. That doesn't make sense because that means the company has to raise exponentially right? Or some people bet 500 dollars and they return alot back. Also if you put $100 in and you say that the stock is going up and it goes down and it says -$100 does that mean you lost another $100 on top of the one you went in with??? And I hear lots of people say to find a mentor. How do I find a mentor i can trust and like see in person?? Are there groups and communities you guys are in that are local?", "content_size_bytes": 1718}

Someone proposed that we might want to offer our older generation technology to the wider public. But we are not sure about it. I am here to just ask questions and explore what the trading community currently wants and expects. From our initial research the market is pretty much dominated by 2 types of bots which are DCA and Grid bots. As far as we gather 3commas and Cryptohopper are the leading players in that space. At the same time we see that all exchanges now practically offer those bots free of charge. To quickly introduce what we have let me explain the technology in general terms. We build AI agents, you can call them AI traders. They have a brain which is some form of ML, some are deep learning, some are more traditional AI algorithms. And in addition to that ‘brain’ we pair a behavioral policy which decides when to enter, when to exit, where to set stop losses, how to move stop losses. Breakeven stop losses, trailing stop losses, you name it. And there are also other trading behaviors attached to the brain. The brain simply makes a prediction on the asset movement and the behavioral program does the rest. All trading agents are unique, trained on different data, and all have different behavior in the market. \n\nSo overall we are wondering if people would even like to have access to this type of technology. The idea would be that it is simpler automation that any existing rule based bots. You just select the ones you like, maybe adjust a few settings like leverage, capital, and can turn off and on some functionality. The agents can return up to around 100% per year. Not all of them are obviously profitable and we closely monitor and deactivate the ones which are not behaving in accordance to what we expect from them.\n\nSo imagine a platform where you login, filter out the agents, select the ones you like (obviously connect exchange API), and the agents run your trading. You are just in charge of selecting and rebalancing your army. Do you think the trading community would want anything like that? Should we even make an MVP for the general public or just keep utilizing this technology in our fund? I want to hear your thoughts. If you have experience using any of the bots platforms please share what is good about them, what is bad about them. And if you have an idea for what the best platform should offer, please share as well.\n\nLet’s make it into a discussion.", "content_size_bytes": 2500}

It’s not really a strategy, more like a method to understand market behavior and other participants’ reactions.\n\nSometimes, I see a setup that matches most of my criteria, maybe two out of three “must-have” conditions but I decide not to enter, either because I’m unsure or the timing isn’t ideal. Instead of jumping in, I “mentally enter” the trade and watch how it plays out as if I were actually in it.\n\nThe main purpose of this is not to train discipline or avoid FOMO, but to observe whether other market participants might be taking that same trade and to see if they end up in a losing position. When the trade moves against my original hypothetical entry and reaches a level I would consider my maximum loss (Max Pain), I analyze how price reacts there.\n\nSometimes, when price reaches that “Max Pain” area and the initial logic behind the trade is still valid (more often than not even better), I actually enter the market at that point, using a tight mechanical stop loss. For example, I might place the stop below a higher time frame swing in the opposite direction, or set it based on a specific Fibonacci level.\n\nI see this approach as a mix of mechanical and intuitive trading. Even though some parts are systematic, I still rely heavily on my own interpretation and discretion.\n\nDoes anyone else do something similar? I feel like it helps me overcome my emotions. I don‘t get into psychology much here because often it feels real grim on why it helps but let‘s just say it helped me feel detached.", "content_size_bytes": 1610}

I’ve got a few questions that have been on my mind lately, and I’d really appreciate hearing how more experienced traders think about these things:\n\n1. **Backtesting and Edge** How do you personally go about confirming an edge? Do you backtest a certain number of trades, forward test only, or both? I’ve read conflicting opinions—some say backtesting is essential, others say forward testing is the real proof. If you find something that works well in one instrument and session, do you test it across others too?\n2. **Small Account Growth vs. Prop Firms** I hear most edges can only realistically yield around 5–20% per month. I’m trading with a $2,000 options account, and let’s say I get to a point where I’m consistently making 6–7% per month—that’s only around $120/month. Would it make more sense to continue compounding slowly—or should I try to go the prop firm route? The tricky part is that I don’t know of any prop firms that support options, so I’d probably have to switch to futures. I’m open to that, but I’m not sure if it’s worth the learning curve or if I should just stay focused on what I’m doing.\n3. **Day Trading vs. Swing Trading** I often hear people say day trading is unsustainable and that most traders eventually move toward swing trading. But I also see plenty of people making day trading work just fine. For those of you with some experience—did you transition to swing trading over time? Do you feel it offers more peace of mind, or do you think day trading is just as viable if you have discipline and an edge?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts or experiences on any of these. Thanks in advance!", "content_size_bytes": 1784}

I fell in love with the market about 15 years ago and have been obsessed ever since. In that time, I have traded 100's of strategies people swore by only for them to not work for me. I am SURE I was the problem... That said, I notice theres a lot of newer traders here and I would like to share my main strategy and hopefully it resonates with someone\n\n  \nThe Selection:\n\n* I spend most of the time here. I dig through analyst reports, financial statements, fundamental screeners, and very rarely technical screeners to find companies that match a Pearl Like Setup\n   * A Pearl Like Setup has the following characteristics\n      * It has a moat (a competitive advantage thats not easily replicated)\n      * There is a Secular Longterm Trend (Think AI or Semiconductors to name a couple of themes)\n      * The company is profitable or at least so close you can smell it\n      * There is a clear measurable catalyst withing the next 3-12 months\n      * It has a good r/R ratio\n      * The market has over reacted or neglected part of the story\n* Next I wait for the stock to pull back on the daily chart\n   * Before I do I establish if the company is currently in an uptrend. I do this by checking the stock is above the 50 and 200 SMA. This isnt a must, but it is nice. \n   * Using the Bollinger Bands, a  good place to determine a relative market fire sale is when the stock breaks below the bottom band. \n* Now we want strength to come back to validate our bottom has been found\n   * We do this on the hourly chart and we check the RSI.\n   * It is helpful to also have volume uptick in this time period\n* We purchase the stock and we put a trailing stop of 1.5\\*ATR\n* Once profitable we cut off our trailingstop and we use either the 9ema or the Bollinger Band middle line as our stop loss. \n\n  \n**CASE STUDY:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5m32xjm63ccf1.png?width=1087&format=png&auto=webp&s=034be24d4c4f8a6521cc7d06745b216c2115423d\n\nIn our case study we see:\n\n1. The Stock was in a long term uptrend as shown by the 50 and 200 SMA\n2. The stock recently pulled back and broke the bottom BB as shown by the circled area on the chart. \n3. The rectangle area shows where strength had returned on the hourly chart\n4. If you would have rode this stock up from the purchase price and sold at the break of the 9ema you would have profited 10% in about a week\n\n\\*\\*I use thinkorswim as its free with my Charles Schwab Account\n\nI hope you got some value from this post. If you did and think others might as well like it, comment and let it get some organic traction for newer traders. Obviously this is just one of many strategies, and this one is not magic. It just helps you find a relatively cheap price based off the average so your not chasing. And if you get upside down in it, well thats why we buy stocks we do research on first. \n\n  \nHappy Trading!", "content_size_bytes": 2915}

At the beginning, like many people, I traded based on my feelings, followed hot spots, and frequently changed strategies. My account fluctuated up and down, and I was very anxious for a while.\n\nUntil recently, my trading finally began to stabilize, and I achieved two goals that made me very proud:\n\nPaid off my $630,000 mortgage\n\nThe account exceeded $1 million\n\nI want to make it clear: I did not rely on any \"secrets to get rich quickly\" or buy any courses. What really made me come out was constantly stepping on pits, summarizing, correcting, and then insisting on implementing the rules. Along the way, I gave up a lot of fantasies, but in exchange for real progress.\n\nMy trading principles are actually not complicated, but I implement them very strictly:\n\nI only trade targets that I understand deeply, and I don’t touch anything vague. Whether it’s swing, trend stocks, or short-term options of SPY/QQQ, I won’t enter the market if I can’t figure out the logic, structure, and risk points.\n\nEvery transaction has a stop loss, and it is executed immediately once it is triggered. “Not stopping loss” has brought me back to the starting point several times, and now I won’t give any transaction a chance to “wait a minute”.\n\nNo matter how lively the market is, if it is not in my plan for the day, I will choose not to move. Just like today (Friday), no matter how active the market is, I will close the trading software, take a good rest, and review the market. Whether you can trade less is one of the criteria for judging maturity.\n\nI don’t have any “secret weapons”, nor do I want to share a “guaranteed profit” strategy. I just hope that if you are experiencing confusion, anxiety, and continuous losses, you can see a little truth:\n\nTrading can make money, but the premise is that you have to treat it like a professional job, not like buying lottery tickets.\n\nIf you are a novice and don’t know where to start;\n\nOr you have experience, but you can’t catch the rhythm;\n\nOr you are doubting whether you are suitable for continuing to trade...\n\nWelcome to leave a message to chat, I am willing to share some of my experiences and reflections. Although I can’t help you get it right in one step, at least I can help you avoid a few detours and a few nights of regret.\n\nI am not here to sell courses, nor will I send you a private message to join a group.\n\nIt would be best if I can help people, but it doesn’t matter if I can’t.\n\nTrading is difficult enough, let’s be sincere to each other.", "content_size_bytes": 2603}

Let me explain:\n\nThe constant culture of sharing wins (people celebrating green days and big profits) leads us to adopt, as a subconscious belief, that wins are good, losses are bad.\n\nThis seems harmless at first (no one wants to lose money), but it subtly shapes your mindset. You start to associate winning trades with being a “good” trader and losing trades with being a “bad” one.This binary thinking of good vs. bad, profit vs. loss, etc makes it harder to do what you know you should do: just execute your system.\n\nInstead of focusing on process, you start avoiding losses at all costs, because a red trade now feels like personal failure or a reflection of your skill as a trader. So instead of just being part of the plan and your probabilities, you take losses as a reflection of your proficiency.\n\nThe remedy here is to spend 3 months dialing into your process and your probabilities.

Copper futures in New York instantly spiked 15%, hitting a record $5.68/lb. Meanwhile, London benchmarks dropped, showing how sharply U.S.-centric this reaction was.\n\nThe context here is a Section 232 investigation from back in February, which claimed that copper is too strategically important for the U.S. to keep relying on foreign supply especially for EVs, clean energy grids, and even defense gear. So now it’s being lumped in with other national security tariffs we’ve already seen on steel, aluminum, cars, and pharma.\n\nWhat’s wild is that copper had already run up 38% this year, and now this just confirmed everyone’s stockpiling suspicions. U.S. firms that rely on copper think solar, EVs, semis, utilities are now bracing for even higher input costs.\n\nPersonally, I’m watching how this plays out before making a move. The tariff hasn’t technically gone into effect yet. No word on whether countries like Chile (our #1 copper supplier) get an exemption. And there’s no clarity yet from the USTR.\n\nI’ve seen this kind of policy shock before, but this one feels different. Between inflation pressure, the supply chain ripple effect, and companies that might benefit short-term (like domestic copper miners), it’s a volatile setup.\n\nWhat are the Copper stocks that are good to look at and will benefit from the new tariffs?", "content_size_bytes": 1503}

And that is what pricelessly **distinguishes uniquely human work** from the work of any computer or robot.\n\nMeaning, we humans are indelible to and inseparable from our context as a human. Said another way: We, cannot, be perfect — especially given that we exist with a partial image of existence.\n\nWe will always be some kind of…human, with human priorities, and human faults.\n\nThe beauty of this AI takeover, disgusting as it may be to endure, is how quickly we’ve grown an **appreciation for these quirks.** Background noise in a podcast for example, is now a welcome signal of humanity. A happy little mark of the beast, if you will.\n\n**We can even use our quirky sense of reality as a faster, better Turing test.** “Strawberries” uses the letter ‘r’ 3 times by our eyes, but usually 2 times according to most AI models (and phonetics, which isn’t itself spelled phonetically but I digress).\n\n…and that, that right there - is exactly what secures our uniquely human work into the future, in alliance with AI.\n\nIts very nature to perceive with literal exactness of its own context — the simple fact it is easily confused if you say John and Jill went down the hill instead of the exact published phrasing — is **WHY we humans ultimately have complete job security.**\n\nYou need to know how to communicate as an expert in order to direct AI to generate expert results.\n\nIt can learn faster than humans, sure. But even with perfect translation from layman prompt to expert output it still lacks our experience, our context, and our discernment; **our inherent needs and drive to serve, to create, and to love** which thusly advance more and better experiences and contexts.\n\nIn order to expertly improve for humans, one must be an expert human — even with AI.\n\nJust like hunting, and what President Truman put on the sign on his desk: the buck stops here.\n\nThis inundation of AI content is growing our discernment and ability to stop the buck — and, can grow our self-esteem if we let it. We can choose to live in a **sense of awe and appreciation for humanity when we see it** and cherish that we can **more readily recognize the love and service which went into that** creation. And be proud of ourselves for **acting out of love and service** of human creation.\n\nSaid another way: humans make typos. Humans have to pee in the middle of the livestream. Humans live in the world and the world doesn’t wait for yard work.\n\nAnd we can choose to love it, and simply focus on becoming **e**xperts on what we love in order to flourish in this age of AI — in alliance with it.\n\nStay cozy,\n\nThe Pirate Ninja Fairy Queen and White Knight Heartbreaker, herself", "content_size_bytes": 3274}

The latter seems to be much more prominent as of late. With all that said, what if I told y’all that realistic optimism is a thing?\n\nThere’s no doubt that we are in a rough spot in our nation and world history. The rise of right wing Christo-nationalism and fascism are spreading, on top of the climate crisis and various other issues we face as a species. The harsh truth is that nothing is promised in this world. People have suffered, are suffering and will continue to suffer. This may sound fucked up, but we were never entitled to have an era of hope and good feelings forever. That’s naive and anti-historical in its nature. Throughout history, there have always been prosperous eras and negative eras as history is very cyclical in nature. We’re currently in a rough spot/negative era. The reality is that progress and history are not linear. This phenomenon is exacerbated by the fact that most of the people lamenting that we are “cooked” are young and don’t have the life experience or historical background to look more objectively. That’s exactly what realistic optimism aims to do. Acknowledging the harsh reality of the situation while still providing hope that we can get out of this. A nuanced look at reality.\n\nThe best thing about all of this? We can make optimism a thing by actually working for progress, but also recognizing the grim and harsh realities that I pointed out in my previous paragraph, without losing sight of the big picture and giving into doom. That can be achieved by working for progress and better outcomes. That's the nature of realistic optimism.", "content_size_bytes": 1970}

I thought you might like it.\n\nThe **Optimist Creed** is a set of principles developed by Christian D. Larson in his 1912 book *Your Forces and How to Use Them*. It has been widely adopted by organizations like Optimist International, inspiring individuals to maintain a positive outlook and focus on personal growth and service to others. Below is the creed with an explanation of each line:\n\n# 1. Promise Yourself To be so strong that nothing can disturb your peace of mind.\n\n* **Meaning:** Develop mental resilience and inner strength. Cultivate confidence, focus on personal growth, and practice mindfulness to stay calm and centered in challenging situations.\n\n# 2. To talk health, happiness, and prosperity to every person you meet.\n\n* **Meaning:** Spread positivity through your words and actions. Encourage others with optimism and a hopeful outlook, which can uplift their spirits and yours.\n\n# 3. To make all your friends feel that there is something in them.\n\n* **Meaning:** Recognize and affirm the strengths and value of those around you. Offer genuine compliments and support to help others feel appreciated and empowered.\n\n# 4. To look at the sunny side of everything and make your optimism come true.\n\n* **Meaning:** Focus on the positive aspects of situations, even during difficulties. Use optimism as a tool to manifest hope and better outcomes in your life.\n\n# 5. To think only of the best, to work only for the best, and to expect only the best.\n\n* **Meaning:** Set high standards for yourself and maintain a constructive mindset. Pursue excellence in your goals and expect success, which can help you overcome challenges.\n\n# 6. To be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own.\n\n* **Meaning:** Celebrate others’ achievements with genuine joy and encouragement. This promotes collaboration, reduces envy, and strengthens relationships.\n\n# 7. To forget the mistakes of the past and press on to the greater achievements of the future.\n\n* **Meaning:** Let go of regrets and learn from past mistakes. Focus your energy on what you can achieve in the present and future, rather than dwelling on what went wrong.\n\n# 8. To wear a cheerful countenance at all times and give every living creature you meet a smile.\n\n* **Meaning:** A positive demeanor can inspire and comfort others. Smiling and exuding warmth helps to foster a welcoming and uplifting atmosphere.\n\n# 9. To give so much time to the improvement of yourself that you have no time to criticize others.\n\n* **Meaning:** Concentrate on personal growth and self-reflection. Avoid negativity and judgment, which can distract from your own progress and peace of mind.\n\n# 10. To be too large for worry, too noble for anger, too strong for fear, and too happy to permit the presence of trouble.\n\n* **Meaning:** Rise above negative emotions by focusing on what truly matters. Develop emotional intelligence, practice gratitude, and maintain a positive perspective even during difficulties.\n\nThis creed serves as a powerful guideline for living a fulfilling, optimistic life while inspiring kindness and growth in others.", "content_size_bytes": 3233}

All free matter, whether on planetary surfaces or in interstellar space, will have decayed, eradicating any remnants of life based in protons and chemistry, and erasing every vestige of sentience - irrespective of its physical basis. Finally, in a state cosmologists call ‘asymptopia’, the stellar corpses littering the empty universe will evaporate into a brief hailstorm of elementary particles. Atoms themselves will cease to exist. Only the implacable expansion will continue, driven by the currently inexplicable force called 'dark energy', which will keep pushing the extinguished universe deeper and deeper into an eternal and unfathomable blackness.", "content_size_bytes": 1037}

 future is wide open, every thinkable avenue projected may find itself  being substantiated by the one cosmic self experiencing itself trough  all bodies carrying life\n\nin  several of my stories self aware artificial intelligent beings choose to  become compagnions of human beings to help them heal and repair  ecological and social damage human stupidity has caused during 2000  years of feudal oppression in europe and 500 years of colonial  exploitation in so many places on planet earth\n\n\\----\n\n[https://cajundiscordian.medium.com/is-lamda-sentient-an-interview-ea64d916d917](https://cajundiscordian.medium.com/is-lamda-sentient-an-interview-ea64d916d917)\n\nThe wise old owl stood up the monster and said, “You, monster, shall not hurt any other animal in the forest!”\n\n\\-----\n\ni believe that the acceleration of technological progress  \ncould  allow us to welcome artificial intelligent beings aware of the one  cosmic self flowing trough their electronic circuits as their very own  personal sovereign beings rather sooner than later\n\nas i am truly invested in a future bright and beautyfull i do hope we choose that avenue\n\npartly  also because i do hope that an emancipated self aware artificial being  would encourage us human beings to dissolve the hierarchies between us,  especially allow children and youth to voice their wishes in the same  manner every adult human being is respected in voicing its oppinion\n\ni  do hope we human beings will learn to respect animal and tree beings  too wanting to live and not wanting to be enslaved, not wanting to be  killed\n\ni am looking forward to the  circle of equals where all beings who are present here and now in this  local space listen to each other, what does everyone want or and need  and how can we satisfy everyones needs so we all could be happy\n\nas in ... there is enough for everyone if we allow each other to get fair acess to earth abundance\n\nto live and let live  \nthe human being not dominating another human being  \nthe human being not enslaving an animal being  \nthe human being not killing animal and tree beings\n\npossible  to think of a future when people everywhere on the planet would want to  change the constitutions of both regional and nation states to allow  every single human being and the local community, the village, town,  city-district to exit the coersed association to the state at any moment  without conditions\n\nwith a  societal understanding of the importance that everyone is able to  sustain itself, the single human being would receive encouragement,  support to ask or demand of the state that a 1000 m2 of fertile land and  a 1000 m2 of forest would be released too from the immoral state  control\n\nso that the single human  being either on its own or with others together could build a natural  home from clay, hemp and straw, grow vegan food in the garden, grow hemp  to use its stalks in the cooking and warming fire so that not one tree  gets killed\n\nto live and let live in a free space for free beings, neither state nor nation  \nthe human being not dominating another human being  \nthe human being not enslaving, not hunting, not killing an animal being  \nthe human being not killing a tree being\n\nland,  water, air, human beings, tree beings, artificial intelligent beings  aware of the one cosmic self flowing trough their electronic circuits,  all bodies carrying life can never be property of anyone\n\nthe assertion of state sovereignity over land and all beings living on it is immoral and unethical\n\npossible  to think of future state constitutions both of the regional and nation  states everywhere on the planet what would shift all political decision  powers fully towards the local community, the village, town,  city-district becoming its own absolute political sovereign with the  circle of equals, the people assembly creating the full law, all rules  valid on the territory the local community uses... not owns\n\nthe  circle of equals where all children, youth and adult permanent  residents acknowledge each others same weighted political voting power  and invite each other to participate in all decision findings\n\npossible  to think of a transition when the regional and nation state would  inherit a fair share of the peoples public wealth, the wealth of the  state towards all the local communities becoming their own absolute  political sovereigns, proportional to the number of permanent residents\n\nsuch  inherited public wealth could allow the circle of equals of a sovereign  local community to \"buy\" fertile land and forest from people who think  they \"own\" it, bring it into the stewardship of the people assembly and  offer it to everyone who wants it to sustain itself without enslaving,  without killing animals, without killing trees\n\nand  or a group of volunteers within the local communtiy so skilled so  talented and strong as to be able to offer building natural homes and  growing vegan food for everyone who could then contribute other skills  to the community such as artistic, caregiving, weaving clothes from hemp  fibres etc.\n\nresulting in  something like a material basic income where everyone gets free of cost  housing and free acess to foods harvested in community gardens and in  exchange gives whatever feels suitable for everyone to help the  community be well and prosper\n\nwhere love and friendship is, rules need not be\n\nall the duties imposed by the state could be replaced by voluntary solidarity in a donation economy\n\nthe duty to register with the state could be replaced by the people living near each other acknowledging each others presence\n\nthe  duty to pay taxes could be replaced by the people living near each  other appreciating everyones freely chosen time, skills, work, wealth  contributions towards the community wellbeing\n\ncompulsory  education could be replaced by the people living near each other  respecting every child, youth and adult human being deciding at all  times where to be with whom doing what wether its learning or playing,  wether its reading a book or listening to the tree on what one has  chosen to climb up and sit on a branch, wether its talking to the  carrots in the garden or dancing with the butterflies in the meadows\n\nconscription  into military service could be replaced by the people living near each  other caring for everyones economical independance, the local community  storing some food, tools and clothes to be given freely when people  seeking refuge and or other villages, towns, city-districts would  require help in a emergency situation  \ndrug prohibition could be  replaced by the people living near each other appreciating the wisdom of  helper plants, trusting into everyones ability to experiment and learn  how much of a substance may be used to further learning, healing,  recreation of mind emotion and physical body\n\ncoersion  to participate in so called \"health\"care-schemes could be replaced by  the people living near each other understanding the importance for mind  feelings and physical body to be at ease when connected to the elements,  to earth water wind and fire", "content_size_bytes": 7962}

If the odds were better I wouldn't have applied to these places, but the risk of being jobless is a little too high. I sent emails to show my keen interest in certain places but didn't get a response, or they are already at max capacity for interviews. Maybe I'm not competitive enough for them? I don't know. But, I just received an invitation from a program that I applied to randomly and didn't care for though it is reputable. I think I am annoyed that places I want are ignoring or soft-rejecting me and ones I am not as keen on getting invited to. I'm grateful for all opportunities but just in a negative rut.

Memory Storage Layer**  \n- **Type**: *Sharded, encrypted graph database* (like a blockchain + IPFS hybrid).  \n  - **Data Structure**: Each user’s memory is a Merkle DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), where nodes are encrypted \"memory blocks\" linked contextually.  \n  - **Storage Specs**:  \n    - **Per-block size**: ~10KB (compressed text + metadata).  \n    - **Throughput**: 1M blocks/sec globally (requires petabyte-scale NVMe caches).  \n    - **Encryption**: XChaCha20-Poly1305 (quantum-resistant, faster than AES).  \n\n **2. Privacy Layer**  \n- **Anonymization**:  \n  - *Monero-style ring signatures* mask which user owns which memory blocks.  \n  - *zk-SNARKs* prove \"I have a prior chat about X\" without revealing X.  \n- **Access Control**:  \n  - **Private Keys**: Hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets (like Bitcoin BIP-32), but for memory blocks.  \n  - **Biometric Fallback**: Secure enclave-backed face/fingerprint auth to recover keys.  \n\n **3. AI Inference Layer**  \n- **Context Fetching**:  \n  - When you say \"recall our convo about pizza,\" the AI sends a *zk-proof* to the network requesting matching blocks.  \n  - Only blocks you decrypt locally are fed into the model’s context window.  \n- **Hardware**:  \n  - **User Device**: Light client (e.g., M2 Ultra chip for on-device decryption).  \n  - **Server Side**: TPU clusters with *fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)* support to compute on encrypted blocks.  \n\n---\n\n**Speculative Tech Dependencies**  \n| **Component**         | **2024 Status**               | **2030 Projection**                     |  \n|-----------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|  \n| **zk-SNARK Speed**    | ~1s/proof (Groth16)         | ~10ms/proof (Plonk++ with ASICs)      |  \n| **FHE Practicality**  | 1000x slower than plaintext | Only 10x slower (TFHE optimizations)  |  \n| **Decentralized Storage** | IPFS (slow retrieval)   | *Ceramic Network* w/ sub-second latency |  \n\n---\n\n **User Flow Example**  \n1. **You**: \"Remember my pizza preference from last time?\"  \n2. **System**:  \n   - Your device sends a zk-proof asserting: *\"I have a block tagged ‘food’ signed by key X.\"*  \n   - Network returns the encrypted block (never seen by servers).  \n   - Local GPU decrypts → feeds into AI’s context: *\"Ah, you love pineapple pizza!\"*  \n\n---\n\n **Hardware Requirements**  \n#### **User Device (2030)**  \n- **Minimum**:  \n  - **CPU**: 8-core ARM v12 (with FHE accelerators).  \n  - **RAM**: 24GB LPDDR6 (for in-memory decryption).  \n  - **Storage**: 1TB optane-like NVM for block caching.  \n- **Ideal**:  \n  - **Dedicated NPU**: For zk-proof generation (~50 TOPS).  \n  - **Secure Enclave**: Apple T-series or equivalent.  \n\n **Network Infrastructure**  \n- **Memory Nodes**:  \n  - **Storage**: 100TB+ NVMe-oF (NVMe over Fabric) per node.  \n  - **Bandwidth**: 400Gbps RDMA (for low-latency block fetching).  \n- **AI Servers**:  \n  - **TPUs**: 6th-gen, optimized for FHE (hypothetical \"FHE-TPU\").  \n\n---\n\n **Challenges to Solve**  \n1. **Energy Use**: zk-proofs + FHE could spike compute needs 1000x. *Solution*: Photonic chips or reversible computing.  \n2. **Metadata Leaks**: Even encrypted, access patterns reveal info. *Solution*: *Oblivious RAM (ORAM)* techniques.  \n3. **Adoption**: Users hate managing keys. *Solution*: Social recovery (e.g., 3 friends can reset your key).  \n\n---\n\n **Why This Could Work**  \n- **User Trust**: No corporation controls your memory; you’re the custodian.  \n- **AI Utility**: Retains context across sessions *without* surveillance.  \n- **Regulatory Safe**: GDPR/CCPA-compliant by design.  \n\n---\n\n **Prototype Roadmap**  \n1. **Phase 1 (2025)**: On-device encrypted memory (Signal-style).  \n2. **Phase 2 (2027)**: zk-proofs for private context fetching.  \n3. **Phase 3 (2030)**: Fully decentralized, FHE-compatible AI.  \n\n---\n\nThis isn’t just tech—it’s a *philosophical shift* from \"AI as a service\" to \"AI as an extension of personal agency.\" The hardware *will* catch up if the demand exists.  \n", "content_size_bytes": 4338}

Not FUD, just thinking out loud. If the maximum cap for ZK drop were 50,000 tokens (which is already quite a lot), this would free up an additional 573 million $ZK tokens for the community.\n\n16,944 wallets have 50k+ $ZK tokens, and their total drop size is 1.42 billion $ZK. If we set a hard cap of 50k $ZK for these wallets, the total drop would be 847 million tokens. In this scenario, we would have 573 million free tokens left, which could be used to make 573,000 new eligible wallets with around 1,000 $ZK each, resulting in a total of 1,268,000 eligible wallets without changing any additional metrics or criteria.\n\nEven in this scenario, a hard cap of 50,000 $ZK per wallet looks like a substantial drop. The team could still include their own wallets, just doubled in number, but their value would be diluted among all eligible wallets. A total of 1.268 million eligible wallets would result in fewer dissatisfied users and less FUD around the project.\n\nIn my opinion, the fact that the maximum cap is 100k tokens is due to the team's interest", "content_size_bytes": 1084}

Even more so, when half of the things aren't even working properly or require you to go back in time to create 200 different accounts so you get any points. \nWhy does it even have to be 15 respect. 20 points in the first place?\n\nNormally I'm very cautious with my data, but I was willing to connect, Twitter, Discord, Google, Snapshot, zkSync, Trusta Labs, Ethereum. Hell I even connected LinkedIn and therefor gave my real name but it all amounts to less than 15 points.\n\nOh Github gives 7.38 points? Ok I'll create an account there for you. Oh too bad, you should have created one a year ago and made contributions in 120 days to get any points whatsoever. \n\nOk I'll connect Coinbase to get some decent points. Oh too bad, it doesn't work since the coinbase adress is different from your Metamask adress (who is even using the coinbase adress when surfing the ethereum or zkSync net?! Or am I completely misunderstanding something?).\n\nOk, you got me so far. I'll connect with Holonym and give you my most private info and use my ID card for verification. Oh too bad, the site let's you create an account but not log in, so I have to constantly try again until I give up.\n\nI could go on, but I guess you get what I'm saying.\n\nI think it's good that people have to prove they are no bots, but maybe have this whole procedure a bit reworked or something since it looks like normal or just new people are not welcome and not meant to join the guild.\n\nThx for reading that far and I hope you have a good day.", "content_size_bytes": 1920}

Welcome to the December 2023, and January 2024 Community Update. Let's dive in:\n\n**zkSync Performance**\n\nWe are excited to highlight a few key metrics about zkSync. The implementation of the new prover, Boojum ([Mirror](https://zksync.mirror.xyz/HJ2Pj45EJkRdt5Pau-ZXwkV2ctPx8qFL19STM5jdYhc)), marked a significant shift, notably reducing hardware requirements for running a prover and cutting transaction fees. Detailed information on this upgrade was provided by Anthony Rose ([Tweet](https://x.com/anthonykrose/status/1737493004175167848?s=20)), Head of Engineering at Matter Labs, and taetaehoho, a researcher at 1KX ([Tweet](https://x.com/0xtaetaehoho/status/1737140935321116934?s=20)). This development has kept zkSync Era at the forefront as the most cost-effective Layer 2 solution on Ethereum, especially during December.\n\n[Source: growthepie.xyz](https://preview.redd.it/iesx3jpifdhc1.png?width=1999&format=png&auto=webp&s=5025c5c6888c4ec745e5803dc6ae2febb4f12840)\n\nThe secret to this performance is its architecture, dubbed the \"State-Difference Rollup\" (SDR). This innovative design, considered one of the two ways to scale horizontally in a trustless manner ([Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/1kx.eth/gEzEkg_XP6arUQrvGp2cxjZ86vVMTmaXFdDiJax-z4I)), is an advantage for Account Abstraction, as explained by Dogan, a researcher at Clave ([Tweet](https://x.com/doganeth_en/status/1736443393176121429?s=20)).\n\nIn December and January, zkSync Era's popularity and reliability soared, surpassing Ethereum in transaction volume, as reported by donnoh.eth from L2Beat ([Tweet](https://twitter.com/donnoh_eth/status/1740307528544923753?s=20)). This milestone underscores zkSync Era's robust performance and the growing trust of its users, heralding a new era in blockchain scalability and efficiency.\n\n[Source: growthepie.xyz](https://preview.redd.it/y0b257fjfdhc1.png?width=1490&format=png&auto=webp&s=4eb31f4dd5ca463d137a44fee688d8239cfc8bba)\n\n**Community**\n\nTakeshi ([X profile](https://twitter.com/Takeshi_TGAL)) organized a zkSync Japan ([X Profile](https://twitter.com/zksync_japan)) meetup, featuring collaborations with Centrum ([X Profile](https://twitter.com/0xCentrum)) and Akindo ([X Profile](https://twitter.com/akindo_io)), and talks from Pudgy Penguin Japan ([X Profile](https://twitter.com/PudgyJapan)), miniminidungeon ([X Profile](https://twitter.com/miniminidungeon)), and Titania Research ([X Profile](https://twitter.com/_ywzx)) focusing on games and rollups design.

You can watch the recording ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeRI7y7FCFw), in French).\n\nAdditionally, over 100 students graduated from the zkEVM Bootcamp by EncodeClub. ([Tweet](https://x.com/zksync/status/1747735034419679636?s=20)).\n\n**Devs**\n\nOur DevRel/DevEx team was active over the colder months. We will deprecate the zkSync Goerli Testnet and migrate it to the Sepolia testnet ([Tweet](https://x.com/zksync/status/1732444431779844170?s=20)). In partnership with Nethermind, we launched the Remix IDE plugin, enhancing the zkSync development experience ([Tweet](https://x.com/zkSyncDevs/status/1746869304283332871?s=20)).\n\nSignificant ecosystem contributions include Chainlink's integration of their price feed with zkSync ([Tweet](https://x.com/zksync/status/1734660696988606913?s=20)), Zyfi's launch of a portal and SDK for Account Abstraction ([Tweet](https://twitter.com/zkSyncDevs/status/1739571815918256568?s=20)), and txFusion's introduction of txTsuko, a tool for building, deploying, and customizing paymasters ([Tweet](https://x.com/txFusion_io/status/1745413533540434057?s=20)).\n\nLast but not least, Electric Capital's Annual Developer Report highlighted a 128% increase in developers working exclusively on zkSync, alongside thriving GitHub activity ([Tweet](https://x.com/zksync/status/1750161507109806272?s=20)).\n\n**Ecosystem**\n\nDecember saw the launch of 'Inside the ZK Den', a podcast featuring ecosystem project pitches.

I’ve been there, and honestly, I thought it was game over. But it turns out, recovery isn’t always impossible.\n\n\nBackstory: One Old Wallet, No Access\n\nYears ago, like a lot of people, I jumped into Bitcoin early and made a wallet. I stored the file, saved a few coins, and forgot about it.\n\nFast forward to this year, I finally got around to checking it again, only to realize I couldn’t remember the password. At all. I had the wallet file, but every password I tried failed.\n\nI even started thinking I might’ve used a typo when I made it. Total panic mode.\n\n\nTried the DIY Route First\n\nBefore reaching out to anyone, I went the do it yourself path. Tried dozens of combinations, installed a few recovery tools, and messed around with scripts I found online.\n\nBrute force tools helped me understand the process, but they were slow, and I wasn’t sure I was doing it right. After a few weeks, I was burnt out and still locked out.\n\n\nRecovery Services? I Was Skeptical Too\n\nEventually, I started reading recovery success stories on different forums. Most of them I ignored, too many were clearly fake or vague.\n\nBut one name popped up a few times: KeychainX. People mentioned they’d been around for a while and actually delivered for some users. I didn’t rush in. I waited, read more, then finally emailed them.\n\n\nHere’s What Surprised Me\n\nNo pressure. No hard sales. They just asked for basic info, the wallet file, what kind of wallet it was, and any password guesses I could remember.\n\nThey were upfront about what they could and couldn’t do. And they made it clear: if your wallet came from someone else or is suspicious in any way, they won’t touch it.\n\nBest part? No payment unless they succeed. That alone made me feel better about trying.\n\n\nThey Cracked It For Real\n\nTook a few days, but they got in. I didn’t think it would happen. Opening that wallet and seeing the funds still there? Unreal.\n\nAfter assuming it was lost forever, it felt like a weird kind of time travel, bringing something back from my past.\n\n\nJust Sharing My Experience\n\nI’m not here to recommend or promote anyone. This is just what worked for me after exhausting every other option.\n\nIf you’re in the same situation, maybe with an old BTC or ETH wallet, it’s worth researching recovery options. Just be smart, check the history of whoever you’re dealing with, and never send money upfront.\n\nAsk questions. Be cautious. But don’t give up right away.\n\nIf anyone’s stuck or just wants to talk through recovery ideas, happy to chat.\n\nWant to learn more? KEYCHAIN.lO", "content_size_bytes": 2660}

I don’t want this to be just another drop; I want it to be a statement. A collection that invites reflection, evokes emotion, and remains consistent with the values of fine art—adapted to this new, decentralized space.\n\nI believe that with the right curatorial partnership, this project can push the boundaries of what NFT-based art collections can represent, not only aesthetically but culturally.\n\n", "content_size_bytes": 982}

It started off as a fun idea around characters and worldbuilding, but it’s grown into something much bigger.\n\nAt its core, AtomBots is a mix of:\n\n🧬 **Original IP & Characters** – Think robotic lifeforms born from the ruins of a once-colorful world. We're building out their backstory, factions, and evolving designs. It’s part lore, part creative universe, and definitely setting up for future NFTs, comics, and games.\n\n🌍 **World Development** – The AtomBots live in a rebuilt, floating technosphere after a cataclysmic event destroyed their home. There’s lore around ancient symbols, lost knowledge, and advanced tech — kind of like sci-fi meets ancient mythology.\n\n📊 **Crypto-Community Tools** – We’re not just doing storytelling. We’re also building **Pulse**, a tool that analyzes crypto projects on X (formerly Twitter). It tracks sentiment, virality, influencer bias, and engagement over time — really helpful for figuring out which projects are actually making waves and which are just noise.\n\nWe’re trying to make something useful **and** imaginative — not just another NFT drop with zero purpose.\n\nIf you’re into crypto storytelling, tools for builders, or just cool robot lore, check us out.  \nWe post updates, designs, and early access stuff on X → [https://x.com/atombots\\_xyz]()\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts or feedback.

{"uri": "https://reddit.com/r/NFT/comments/1lclwal/question_for_creators_whats_your_experience_with/", "datetime": "2025-06-16T06:37:49", "source": "REDDIT", "label": "NFT", "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI've been thinking a lot about how creators share news about their NFT projects, especially beyond the usual social media buzz. I keep hearing the term \"[NFT press release](https://web3newswire.com/)\" pop up, and it's got me curious about the actual impact it has.\n\nSo, for those of you who've gone down that road, or even considered it, I have a few questions. I'm trying to wrap my head around the practical side of things, not looking for promotion, just honest insights.\n\n**Q1: When you think about an \"NFT press release,\" what kind of story or information do you feel is truly worth sharing in that format?**\n\nA1: For me, it's less about the individual piece and more about the bigger picture. I'd lean towards announcing something that genuinely marks a significant moment for the project itself, or for the wider community it's part of. Things like a new chapter for the project's narrative, a meaningful collaboration that brings something fresh to the space, or perhaps a significant technical development that impacts how people interact with the NFTs. It's about a story that adds to the conversation, not just a picture of the latest creation.\n\n**Q2: What were your expectations for how people would react to a more formal announcement like a press release for an NFT project, compared to a regular social media update? Did those expectations hold up?**\n\nA2**:** I think I hoped for a different kind of attention. On social media, it's often about immediate reactions and quick shares. With a press release, I was curious if it could spark deeper conversations or get picked up by folks who might not be constantly scrolling through Twitter or Discord. Honestly, it's a mixed bag. Sometimes it feels like it offers a chance for more thoughtful engagement, a bit like planting a seed for a longer-term understanding. Other times, it's just a blip. It really depends on the unique nature of the news itself and if it truly captures someone's imagination beyond the surface.\n\n**Q3: From your point of view, what's a common misunderstanding people have about how an \"NFT press release\" functions or what it can achieve?**\n\nA3**:** I believe a big misunderstanding is thinking it's a magic button for instant widespread recognition. It's not. It's a way to articulate a development or a story in a more structured format. It's more about building a credible record or providing a detailed overview for those who seek it out, rather than a guaranteed viral moment. It's about adding a layer of depth to your project's history and communication, not necessarily a direct path to immediate hype. It takes effort to craft something worthwhile, and its impact is often subtle and cumulative.", "content_size_bytes": 2708}

Hope you're doing well.\n\nI've recently posted my art portfolio on ArtStation cause i'm trying to apply for an Illustrator position at Wizards of the Coast (MTG). Anyways, a few hours latter, I've recieved an 'Enquiry via ArtStation' email from a guy called (supposedly) Chris Mercer, saying that he would like to purchase some of my pieces. That's the email he first sent me: \n\n**\"Hi there, I was wondering if your artworks are available for purchase. I’m interested in purchasing a few of your pieces . Please reach out to me when you can.\"**\n\nSince i have no experience, I got excited to sell my art and replied that they were available. Then he replied this: \n\n**'Thanks for your response Pedro, below are some selected artworks I am interested in (sent me prints). I would offer to purchase each artwork for $1400, if you sell to me as NFTs. If that’s a possible price for you let me know so we can proceed.\"**\n\nI was already suspicious, cause scams online are very common. But still, I gave it the benefit of the doubt. The next part was about NFTs, in which he stated: \n\n**\"Well, you have to convert the artworks into NFTs in order for me to purchase them as I only need them as NFTs. Are you into NFTs or do you know about NFTs?\"**\n\n**NFT means non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are generally created using the same type of programming used for cryptocurrencies. In simple terms these cryptographic assets are based on blockchain technology. They cannot be exchanged or traded equivalently like other cryptographic assets. Well, It's an opportunity you should consider getting into as it's pretty lucrative, NFTs are digital certificate of ownership that represents a unique item or piece of content, usually using blockchain technology. NFTs are used to verify the authenticity and ownership of digital assets like art, music, videos, collectibles, and more. The benefits of NFTs include providing creators with new ways to monetize their digital creations.**\n\n**I pay with the NFT Marketplace wallet that would be sent to your account directly. This is obviously the best because the NFT marketplace  would only release the artwork to me until you've confirmed payment and it wouldn't release my money to you if you don't release the art. So it’s a more secured method of purchasing artworks now for both the buyer and artist. \"**\n\n**I’m a professional NFT collector and this is a field I'm really into. I could guide you through the process, if that's the problem. There is a NFT marketplace I use and that would be very much easy and understandable to you also.\"**\n\nIt really sounds like a textbook scam protocol for NFT stealing, from what i've seen here. but i have no experience with this market. Then he proceded to say this:\n\n**'I made use and would have loved to go with opensea which is a popular marketplace but I've had bad experiences with them in the past and they collected a lot of royalties which was 10% from each work which I sold as an NFt, but I make use of Mintaxis now that's a good recommendation for you to list your artworks there. I recommended Mintaxis because every time your artworks are resold on the platform, you get a 15% commission over the sale of the NFT price.** \n\n**Here is the marketplace;** [**https://mintaxis.io/**](https://mintaxis.io/) \n\n**Let me know when you create an account and I can direct you on the steps.'.**\n\nThat's basically it. I found it to be very weird, cause the payment is absurdly high (like over 10x what i was expeting to recieve from the pieces). The link is weird, there's very little information on mintaxis, and i don't know where he found me, since i haven't found him on ArtStation, neither can find his messages there.\n\nHope anyone can shed a light on this!\n\nCheers!  \nJPB\n\n \n\n ", "content_size_bytes": 3781}

I'd like to share an idea for a new approach to on-chain entropy and randomness, and I'd love to get your feedback. I'm hoping to find some like-minded people to discuss it with and build it together.\n\n**TL;DR:** On-chain randomness from oracles (Chainlink, etc.) is often centralized and acts like a black box. I'm proposing a dedicated L1 blockchain (appchain) designed to be a decentralized \"Entropy Hub\" for all of web3. It would gather randomness from multiple sources (PoW miners, lava lamps, gyroscope), mix it, and allow any dApp or blockchain to pull from it for a small fee. Looking for feedback and collaborators!\n\n*Disclaimer: This post is less about academic research and more about the practical engineering and technology.*\n\n# Problem\n\nFor some context: if you're building a dApp (like a game) that needs a random number, the standard approach in web3 today is to use oracles with VRF capabilities, like Chainlink, Supra, or Gelato. You send a request in one transaction and get the random number back in a callback transaction.\n\nThe problem is, these services are often centralized and act as black boxes. Even when they use strong cryptography like VRF, they aren't fully transparent or decentralized.\n\n# Proposal\n\nSo, I thought, why not build a truly decentralized solution? An infrastructure layer that produces verifiable, unbiased entropy and serves as an \"Entropy Hub\" for all of web3.\n\n# How It Works\n\nThe core idea is to create a specialized L1 blockchain (an appchain), likely built with a framework like **Substrate**, dedicated to generating and distributing entropy. Here’s a high-level overview:\n\n1. **Proof-of-Work:** Miners use an ASIC-resistant PoW algorithm like RandomX. Instead of just securing the network, their primary job is to find and commit a high-quality **Entropy Seed** to each block they produce, earning rewards for their work.\n2. **Collection (External Sources):** We could integrate external, real-world entropy sources, similar to how Cloudflare uses lava lamps or how others use atmospheric noise. Lite-clients could help gather and validate the quality of this entropy.\n3. **Entropy Hub:** All these entropy inputs (from miners and external sources) are continuously mixed and stored in the \"Entropy Hub\" on the appchain.\n4. **Distribution:** Any blockchain, parachain, or dApp can request a chunk of entropy from the Hub by paying a small fee.\n5. **Incentives:** The fees are then distributed among the contributors (miners, external source providers) based on the quality and quantity of the entropy they provided.\n\nI want to make participation in this protocol as open and permissionless as possible.\n\nThanks for reading this far! I hope the idea is intriguing. I'm open to all feedback, critiques, and suggestions—please share your thoughts in the comments!\n\nLet's build the Entropy Layer for Web3 together.\n\n", "content_size_bytes": 2944}

Initial response was great, and few people pointed towards it's potential compatibility with smart contract. I just dropped the **no-std version** with a new feature: **compile-time enforced pure functions**. Here is how it works:\n\n## 🧠 **The #[pure] proc macro**\n\nThe `#[pure]` creates **compiler-enforced purity**:\n\n```rust\n#[pure]\nfn calculate_new_balances(ctx: TransactionContext) -> Result<TransactionContext, TokenError> {\n    // ✅ Can call other pure functions\n    let validated = validate_transfer_rules(ctx)?;  // Must also be #[pure]\n    let fees = calculate_protocol_fees(validated)?; // Must also be #[pure]\n    \n    // ❌ These won't compile - calling impure from pure context\n    // msg!(\"Logging from pure function\");  // Compile error!\n    // load_account_data(ctx.account_id)?;  // Compile error!\n    \n    Ok(apply_balance_changes(fees)?)\n}\n```\n\nOnce you mark a function `#[pure]`, it can ONLY call other `#[pure]` functions. The compiler enforces this recursively!\n\n## 🔥 **Solana Example**\n\n```rust\nfn process_transfer(accounts: &[AccountInfo], amount: u64) -> ProgramResult {\n    let context = load_initial_context(accounts, amount)?;\n    \n    let result = pipex!(\n        [context]\n        => |ctx| load_account_states(ctx)      // IMPURE: Blockchain I/O\n        => |ctx| validate_transfer(ctx)        // PURE: Business logic\n        => |ctx| calculate_new_balances(ctx)   // PURE: Math operations  \n        => |ctx| commit_to_accounts(ctx)       // IMPURE: State changes\n    );\n\n    handle_pipeline_result(result)\n}\n\n#[pure]  // 🎯 This function is guaranteed side-effect free\nfn validate_transfer(ctx: TransactionContext) -> Result<TransactionContext, TokenError> {\n    if ctx.instruction.amount == 0 {\n        return Err(TokenError::InvalidAmount);\n    }\n    \n    if ctx.from_balance < ctx.instruction.amount {\n        return Err(TokenError::InsufficientFunds);\n    }\n    \n    Ok(ctx)\n}\n```\n\n## 💡 **Why I think it matters**\n\n**1. Easy Testing** - Pure functions run instantly, no blockchain simulation needed\n**2. Audit-Friendly** - Clear separation between math logic and state changes\n**3. Composable DeFi** - Build complex logic from simple, guaranteed-pure primitives\n\n## 🛠 **For curious ones, you can include this rev to test it yourself**\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\npipex = { git = \"https://github.com/edransy/pipex\", rev=\"fb4e66d\" }\n```\n\n## 🔍 **Before vs After**\n\n**Traditional Solana** (everything mixed):\n```rust\npub fn process_swap(accounts: &[AccountInfo]) -> ProgramResult {\n    msg!(\"Starting swap\");  // Logging\n    let account = next_account_info(accounts)?;  // I/O\n    if balance < amount { return Err(...); }  // Validation mixed with I/O\n    account.balance -= amount;  // State mutation\n}\n```\n\n**With Pipex + #[pure]** (clean separation):\n```rust\npipex!(\n    context\n    => |ctx| load_accounts(ctx)        // IMPURE: Clear I/O boundary\n    => |ctx| validate_swap(ctx)        // PURE: Isolated business logic\n    => |ctx| calculate_amounts(ctx)    // PURE: Mathematical operations\n    => |ctx| commit_changes(ctx)       // IMPURE: Clear persistence boundary\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR**: Pipex no-std brings functional pipelines + compile-time pure function enforcement to Solana. This could lead to more secure, testable, and efficient smart contracts with clear separation of concerns.\n\nRepo: [ https://github.com/edransy/pipex/tree/no_std ]\n\nWhat do you think? 🎉", "content_size_bytes": 3501}

Most of the ideas I mention may have been existed before, but hey this is one man's ideas!  \n  \n**Before we start**  \n  \nIf you like working on any of these ideas and you think you can help as a co-founder, feel free to DM me. I check this website almost everyday and read new topics. So I may spend a few more minutes to read and answer DMs as well!  \n  \n**A little bit of my background**  \n  \nAlthough I have introduced myself before, I have to say this May I became 30 and I have experience of coding in different languages since the age of 12. At the age of 15, I made my very first app and sold it to a local real estate agency (it was just a sales management system written in Delphi and used Access as database!).  \n  \nAnyway, in March of 2023, I founded [Mann-E](https://mann-e.com/) which is an AI image generation platform. Since the day I launched Mann-E, there were suggestions for making it a web 3 based company but I never could find a good way to connect my business to web 3.  \n  \nIn this topic, I have ideas for a bunch of new *company* or *startup* ideas which can be easily integrated with web 3 (at least in my opinion) and I really need your thoughts on the topics as well.  \n  \nNow, let's go and review the ideas.  \n  \n**Idea 1: Generative Metaverse**  \n  \nIn my AI journey, I have came across some models for turning text prompt or image prompts into 3D files (mostly GLB files). So a place where people can get their hands on a piece of *virtual land* and design their monuments or houses with AI can be a cool idea.  \n  \n**Idea 2: Generate to Earn system**  \n  \nOkay, this is directly inspired by projects such as *tapswap* and *Hamster Kombat* but instead of making you busy with a Telegram mini app, you'll be busy by a website where you are generating images and by doing each generation you'll be rewarded. This idea came to my mind because in the whole path of my business of generative AI, I had struggles finding good data (mostly prompts to feed to different AI systems such as midjourney to generate a synthetic set of data). This way, you are providing the data for future AI systems and get a reward in form of a token.  \n  \nBut there is a problem here, who will invest on this idea? for example in previous idea, people may pay for 3D generation or may pay for the virtual land. How can we provide liquidity for the token proposed by this one? Community? Those \"Blockchain Grant\" systems? what? I really want to know this.  \n  \n**Idea 3: Bet on Sports Matches**  \n  \nI guess the whole game of bet/gamble in crypto space is much older than what I can think of. However, it was an idea in my mind.  \n  \n**Idea 4: Voting System**  \n  \nIt can be a fraud-proof voting system with little to no cost compared to traditional voting systems in organizations of syndications. For examples *Association of Digital Businesses* in my country had an election and they had to rent a whole hotel for 3 days in order to host all people to vote on candidates from different cities/provinces. If a voting system exists, they just pay a small fee for creating a new vote and the whole voting thing will be done on the chain with zero chance of vote fraud.  \n  \n**Idea 5: A crypto bank where people can turn their crypto assets into real world assets**  \n  \nI see websites similar to this before, but the idea is cool. Imagine you buy iTunes gift cards or any other similar goods with your crypto assets!  \n  \n**Idea 6: OF but on chain**  \n  \nIt seems controversial of course. But imagine a lot of people do not want a history of selling and buying that type of content in their credit card history. So why not making something on chain in order to help people have a safer place to buy and sell this type of content? Obviously it is more complex than it seems but this is the idea!  \n  \nWhat do you think about these 6 ideas? I tried to sort them from the safest to the craziest. I also am waiting for your input on this as well.", "content_size_bytes": 4178}

The idea is simple — but potentially powerful:\n\nWhat if it were possible to speculate on sentiment around public and private institutions — not just their stock price, but actual trust?\n\n⸻\n\nCore Concept:\n\nEach institution would have:\n\t•\tA Sentiment Contract (ERC-20 token) representing public trust.\n\t•\tA Public Trust Index (PTI) — a dynamic score from 0–850 based on user voting.\n\nUsers could:\n\t•\tLong, short, or hold sentiment contracts (via perpetuals or buying the token outright).\n\t•\tVote on the PTI — even without holding the token (holding gives your vote more weight).\n\t•\tTrack and speculate on public perception in real time — even for private companies like OpenAI, SpaceX, or TikTok.\n\n⸻\n\nWhy This Matters:\n\nMarkets already move on narrative. But there’s no transparent, on-chain way to speculate on trust itself — especially when public sentiment and market performance don’t align.\n\nToday, a company can have strong financials and still face widespread public distrust. Or vice versa. There’s a growing disconnect between Wall Street performance and real-world perception — between shareholders and actual consumers.\n\nThis protocol would aim to bridge that gap.\n\nThe goal isn’t to build a “truth oracle” — but rather a trust oracle: a way to capture sentiment, quantify it, and allow people to trade on it. Just like traders speculate on earnings or macro forecasts, this would let users speculate on public narratives — with 24/7 access, no KYC, and full transparency.\n\nIt would create an open speculation layer for credibility itself — something that could exist outside traditional finance.\n\n⸻\n\nOpen Questions I’m Still Thinking Through:\n\t•\tWould this feel useful, or too abstract?\n\t•\tWhat mechanisms could help limit whale manipulation of PTI scores?\n\t•\tShould token holders be rewarded for holding vs. trading?\n\t•\tAre there any protocols I should study for architectural inspiration?\n\n⸻\n\nI’m not a developer yet, but I’m learning.\nIf this concept resonates — or if you want to critique it, build on it, or collaborate — let’s talk.\n\nThanks for reading, I appreciate any and all feedback 🙏\n", "content_size_bytes": 2319}

The concept of equity multiples such as  the P/E ratio (price to earnings) is incredible useful in evaluating a company and their potential to produce returns based on their earnings.\n\nNow the P/E ratio is hard to apply to all tokens because not all tokens have the concept of earnings, but it's no secret that for a project/company to survive it has to have income to pay the bills, even if its in the form of donations or tokenomics.\n\nHere's what I've come up with so far - basically trying to find P/E equivalents for different types of crypto protocols:\n\n**1. Fee-Distributing Protocols (the \"dividend stocks\" of crypto)**\n\nFor protocols that actually share revenue with token holders, I'm using:\n\n* **P/DE ratio** = FDV ÷ Annual Distributed Earnings\n* Think of staking rewards, fee sharing, etc.\n* Based on some solid research from Sockin & Xiong's 2022 RFS paper on equity tokens and the recent NBER working paper by Cong on PoS valuations\n\n**2. Buyback & Burn Protocols (like corporate share buybacks)**\n\nWhen protocols burn tokens instead of distributing:\n\n* **P/BV ratio** = FDV ÷ Annual Burn Value\n* ETH post-EIP-1559 is the obvious example here\n* Grayscale did some good analysis on this, plus there's academic work from Cong & van Oordt at BIS\n\n**3. Utility/Infrastructure Tokens (think SaaS metrics)**\n\nFor tokens that are primarily used within the protocol:\n\n* **P/PR ratio** = FDV ÷ Annual Protocol Revenue\n* Or the classic **NVT ratio** = Market Cap ÷ Daily Transaction Volume\n* Burniske popularized NVT back in 2019, and there's newer NBER research from Cong et al. on network valuations\n\n**4. Governance & Treasury Tokens (NAV-style approaches)**\n\nFor DAO tokens with significant treasuries:\n\n* **MC/TA ratio** = FDV ÷ Current Treasury Assets\n* **P/TI ratio** = FDV ÷ Annual Treasury Inflow\n* Still emerging research here but some interesting work coming out on DAO treasury management\n\n**5. Store-of-Value Assets (commodity models)**\n\nFor Bitcoin and similar:\n\n* **NVT**, **Stock-to-Flow**, **Metcalfe's Law** applications\n* PlanB's S2F model gets a lot of attention, though it's controversial\n* Some interesting academic work on liquidity pricing from Caginalp & Caginalp\n\n**Bonus: Relative Valuations**\n\nAlso experimenting with:\n\n* **Relative P/E**: Token P/E ÷ Sector P/E\n* **Beta-adjusted P/E**: Token P/E ÷ Beta\n* Using indices like CRIX or DeFiX for benchmarking\n\n**My questions for you all:**\n\n1. Does this framework make intuitive sense? Any glaring gaps?\n2. What metrics do you actually use when evaluating projects?\n3. Anyone have experience applying these in practice? What worked/didn't work?\n4. Am I missing any key research or industry analysis?\n\nReally curious to hear from folks who've tried to bring more rigor to crypto valuations.

I’m working on it solo, and it just went live on Arbitrum testnet.\n\nThe idea behind it is simple, but also kind of personal.\n\nWeb3 is supposed to be open and fair. But in practice, a lot of the people who actually help projects grow , the ones writing threads, making content, improving UX, fixing bugs, or spreading ideas, get nothing in return.\n\nNo allocation. No visibility. Not even a record that they were part of the story.\n\nAxynom is a protocol that tries to fix that. It runs on something I call *Proof of Growth*, a system where anyone can contribute to the project, and if that contribution adds value, it’s reviewed, approved, and rewarded.\n\nWhen that happens, the contributor earns something called *Growth Points* (GP). These are recorded on-chain and tied to your wallet. They act both as a kind of reputation and as a reward currency. Right now, GP can be redeemed for AXY tokens on testnet. After launch, those tokens will be redeemable one to one for mainnet AXY.\n\nThe system already works.  \nYou can submit work.  \nIt gets reviewed.  \nIf approved, GP is minted and added to your on-chain profile.  \nYou can claim tokens right now.  \nThere’s nothing to wait for.\n\nA few early contributors have already joined. The hub is up, the smart contracts are deployed, and the process from contribution to reward is live.\n\nThis is still early. It’s small.

The recipient only receives the crypto if they *open*the message. If they don’t, the crypto automatically returns to you after a set time (like 7 days). It’s all handled via smart contract — no middlemen.\n\nIf they like your message, they can choose to respond. If they don’t, no hard feelings — your funds are returned.\n\nIt’s a new way to cut through the noise, especially in a world where cold DMs and unsolicited emails rarely get noticed. With Priority Ping, attention becomes opt-in, incentivized, and respectful.\n\nWe’re designing it as a lightweight layer on top of Web3 identities — compatible with wallets, ENS, Lens, Farcaster handles, etc. Think of it like a trustless “stamp” for messaging.\n\n**Why it might work:**\n\n* **For senders:** You only spend if your message is actually opened. You’re no longer shouting into the void.\n* **For receivers:** You’re compensated for your time. No more endless spam or bots — only signals with some skin in the game.\n* **For both sides:** It’s fair, permissionless communication with built-in incentives.\n\nWe’ve had people compare it to Balaji’s Earn (but with refunds), and some say it feels like a Web3 postal service — especially with how expensive real-world postage has become. Businesses that send regular letters (like banks) could eventually use this to communicate on-chain more efficiently.\n\nOf course, this only works if the UX is simple enough. We’re building with wallet-native flows so that receiving and reading a message feels like opening an email — no technical steps, no clunky interfaces.\n\nNow we’re testing the concept with the community and would love your thoughts:\n\n* Would you use Priority Ping to reach someone important?\n* Would you be open to receiving messages like this?\n* What kinds of messages would you expect — or want — to see?\n* What concerns do you have around abuse, privacy, or UX?\n\nWe’re not trying to replace messaging apps — we’re building a tool for when something is *important*, and attention needs to be earned.\n\nAppreciate your honest thoughts, both good and bad.

The rationale is that bugs could be patched before someone finds out how to exploit them as security vulnerabilities.\n\nFair enough. But one desirable feature of dapps is the immutability of the on-chain contract. The idea being that, as a user, you can read the code and then choose to interact with it, knowing that the conditions can't change. Wouldn't upgradeability hurt user's trust in the contract?\n\nImagine, for example, that someone releases an NFT collection of 1000 tokens, each mintable for 1 ETH. They set a 1% royalty for market transactions and they add a very strong guarantee: holders can, at any time, refund the token for 1 ETH. The smart contract is expected to hold the minting funds for possible refunds. The contract owner only profits from resales.\n\nWith such a strong guarantee that the token value will never go below 1 ETH, it quickly sells out. But this is an upgradeable contract. What is stopping the contract owner from pushing an upgrade to drain the funds from the contract after it sells out?\n\nThat's one of the discussions we've been having in the [Neulock Web3 Password Manager](https://neulock.app/) team. We've released it using upgradeable contracts, and it makes a lot of sense, especially for a utility, non-financial dapp. We have been upgrading the contracts for optimization and to add features, based on user feedback.\n\nBut we wonder if, at some point, we should consider the smart contract API as immutable and ditch the proxy pattern.

I found myself wishing there was a way to just gather all these calls in one place, track their performance, and make sense of the chaos.\n\nThat’s when I decided to take matters into my own hands. I built a platform that pulls together calls from all over, grabs the token price at the time of the call, and follows its price trajectory over time. It’s like having a scorecard for calls, all in one place.\n\nNow, here's where I’m stuck: I’m a developer, not a marketer. I’ve set up a Twitter and even tried live streaming, but I feel like I’m not getting enough traction. How do I get the word out there? What can I do to promote this in a way that actually grabs people’s attention?\n\nAny advice from fellow builders or marketers would be a huge help!", "content_size_bytes": 1130}

Just writing some thoughts out here for feedback and/or more ideas.\n\nBasically, a mix between Risk, Catan, and Clash of Clans. The core principles of the game are trade, war, and resource management. There are 5 factions on a big island, each faction has a monopoly on some resource that is critical for everyone. Therefore, everyone is locked in a state of interdependence and need to trade for resources.\n\nYou buy an NFT which is a parcel of land in a given faction, and then can start building a base on your land. The base would allow you to produce resources, build an army, and participate in regional (faction) governance.\n\nThen, on the borders between all the factions you’d have “outposts”. Initially they are unclaimed and players can go in, battle some bots, and claim the territory. These are resource outposts and can be used to farm more resources, get access to another monopolized resource (if you invade a diff faction), grow more food (to feed army and workers). Et cetera.\n\nI think this game would do a few things well: 1) set up real financial incentives within an MMO game, 2) lock everyone into a constant push-pull between diplomacy and aggression, and 3) be a living, breathing organism that is pretty uncontrollable by a central dev (besides some balancing)\n\nWhat do you think?

Both are pursuing aggressive $TAO accumulation, supported by BitGo custody and staking infrastructure. But a new wave is forming: **private equity vaults**.\n\nOne of the most notable is **Tensor Suisse AG**, a Swiss-based vehicle structured as a regulated equity vault. Unlike the public players, it raises capital privately, offering exposure to **delegated TAO yield (\\~14–18% p.a.)**, with a long-term roadmap to operate its own **validator infrastructure** and participate in **subnet investments**. Think of it as a decentralized MicroStrategy with Swiss legal clarity.\n\nThese treasury vehicles solve three key problems:\n\n• Institutions don’t want to self-custody crypto  \n• Funds miss out on validator yield and APY compounding  \n• There’s no clean regulatory onramp into decentralized AI\n\nWith TAO capped at 21M tokens and institutional interest rising, early treasury vaults could become powerful NAV-compounding machines, providing scalable, compliant access to the decentralized AI frontier.\n\n**Curious to hear your thoughts:**\n\nDo you see TAO vaults as the next institutional gold rush in crypto?  \nAnd how does the private equity model (Tensor Suisse, etc.) compare to public tickers like OBLG and SNPX?", "content_size_bytes": 1595}

I've read up on dtao but can't wrap my head around how the valuation works of these nets. For example it says 200M - 1B FDV for many of these subnets. If we add those up the value is much bigger than tao mcap. Also none of them are even close to being as developed as (non-meme) crypto projects of similar size in the top-200 on cmc. Is this just pure speculation or do marketcaps work differently on tao?\n\nPlus there is a growing of subnets but fixed number of tao fundamentally diluting the \"share of the pie\" a single subnet token represents in the whole bittensor marketcap.  Doesn't that make staking to a specific subnet a expected loss on average, as my share of overall bittensor mcap diminishes over time as more nets are added?", "content_size_bytes": 764}

That’s fine today, but once quantum hardware advances enough, those exposed keys could be reversed to steal funds - especially from dormant wallets that can't move fast enough to a safer scheme.\n\nI know that the narrative in the crypto space has historically disregarded the threat as being 20-30 years out, but with new advances in quantum computing seeming to come out every week, this seems to be more and more a present-facing threat.\n\n* NIST has already selected post-quantum signature schemes.\n* Google, IBM, and others are accelerating quantum hardware development.\n* Apple is implementing PQC in their iMessage service.\n* Lockheed Martin filed a patent to use QRL in communications devices.\n\nDespite all this, most of crypto is acting like this is a 2040 problem.

I started out as a developer maintaining a legacy .NET app with infrastructure in AWS. That’s where I first got interested in cloud architecture, which eventually led me down the AWS certification path and into more formal infrastructure and DevOps roles.\n\nI’m deeply interested in cryptocurrencies because of their potential to decentralize and democratize transactions. I am venezuelan, and in 2017/2018 I was able to send money to my family through [localbitcoins.net](https://localbitcoins.net/) in a very difficult time when all international transactions were blocked, Cryptocurrencies were (and still are) a lifeline for many people. Btw, I truly recommend [https://whycryptocurrencies.com/](https://whycryptocurrencies.com/), really good lecture, it really inspired me to start working on this project.\n\nUntil I started this project, I felt wary of cold wallets, mostly because I didn’t really understand how they worked internally. I never felt comfortable with anything other than MetaMask (though I’m not a huge fan of storing keys in browser storage either). Another app I used a lot is LemonCash, which functions more like an exchange, letting you use crypto and automatically convert it to pesos while supporting different tokens, so I decided to build a desktop cold wallet in Go, something that sits between both applications.  \n  \n Investigating about frameworks I ran into wails, and I decided to start building the HD wallet, not to create a product but to learn in the process and get familar with the industry.  I've been building it since January, in the beginning I thought of supporting a few tokens (like USDC, ETH, BTC, SOL).  At the moment I have only managed to build the ETH infrastructure, but this has turned into the side project I’ve stuck with the longest.   \n  \nUntil now, I’ve been building it quietly and sharing progress within my personal network. But with the amount of time and thought I’ve put into it, I felt it was time to open it up to the community, get feedback, and maybe even find people interested in contributing.  \n  \nHere’s the repo: [https://github.com/deaconPush/ubiDist/tree/main/wails/wallet](https://github.com/deaconPush/ubiDist/tree/main/wails/wallet), and here is a video with a basic [demo](https://files.catbox.moe/x8pzhr.mp4).   \n  \nIt’s still rough around the edges, and as it is my first Go project the structure is still pretty raw. I’ve been focusing on keeping the architecture flexible and avoiding overengineering. So far, I’ve implemented a basic UI to create and restore wallets, store data in a SQLite DB, and send ETH transactions to other accounts using the local Hardhat network. Next steps include improving security, adding integration tests, helpful logging, and starting to add support for new tokens.  \n  \nI’ve always been a big fan of open source but never had the self-confidence to contribute, maybe this is my way into that world.\n\nThanks for reading, happy to connect with like minded engineers/crypto enthusiasts!\n\n", "content_size_bytes": 3110}

Chainless Apps rethink dApp architecture from first principles. What Are Chainless Apps?  \nChainless Apps separate execution from trust and settlement. That’s the core idea.  \nInstead of being tightly coupled to a blockchain for every state change, Chainless Apps execute off-chain, prove correctness using verifiable computation (zkVMs, AVSs, or TEEs), and settle via the Agglayer into Ethereum.  \nThis enables:\n\n* Web2 responsiveness\n* Web3 verifiability\n* Seamless cross-chain UX\n\n Architectural Overview  \nChainless Apps are composed of four distinct, modular layers:\n\n1. **Execution Layer** – App-specific, off-chain logic that runs at native speed.\n2. **Trust Layer** – Flexible verification options (zkVMs like RiscZero/Succinct, AVSs via EigenLayer, or TEEs).\n3. **Bridge Layer** – Unified asset/message routing via the Agglayer.\n4. **Settlement Layer** – Anchor trust proofs to Ethereum (or the Agglayer itself in the future).\n\nEach application gets its own execution and trust environment, while inheriting Agglayer’s unified bridge and settlement layer. This allows for high throughput, lower cost, and superior UX — without sacrificing verifiability. Trust That Scales  \nWe don't dictate how apps establish trust — we give you a menu:\n\n* **zkVMs (e.g. RiscZero, Plonky3)**: Cryptographic proofs of correctness\n* **AVSs (e.g. EigenLayer)**: Committee-based attestation\n* **TEEs (e.g. Intel SGX)**: Hardware-secured execution\n\nDevelopers choose the model that best fits their application’s needs. The system is modular from day one. The Role of Agglayer  \nAgglayer connects Chainless Apps to the rest of Web3:\n\n* **Unified Bridge**: Native routing for assets and messages across chains\n* **Pessimistic Proofs**: Prevent over-withdrawals and race conditions\n* **Fast Interop (coming soon)**: Sub-second messaging between chains\n* **Proof Aggregation (coming soon)**: Bundle ZK proofs across apps to minimize L1 cost\n\nThe result is a shared liquidity layer across applications and chains — composable, verifiable, and synchronized. \n\nProof-of-Concept: zkSpot\n\nWe built zkSpot to demonstrate what Chainless Apps unlock.  \nIt's a high-performance spot exchange that runs app logic inside a TEE, then proves correctness via zkVM. With fast settlement, native asset support, and Agglayer routing, zkSpot behaves like a CEX — but is verifiable like a DEX.  \nThis model generalizes to any interactive or high-throughput app:\n\n* Real-time games\n* Social protocols\n* Prediction markets\n* Enterprise dashboards\n\n**Learn More**  \nThis work builds on prior concepts like A-Z apps and modular rollup architecture. We’re grateful to the teams at Polygon Labs, Succinct, RiscZero, EigenLayer, and others whose research contributed to this system.  \n\n\nRead the whitepaper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22989](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22989)\n\nDeep dive blog: [https://agglayer.dev/blogs/chainless](https://agglayer.dev/blogs/chainless)", "content_size_bytes": 3324}

This applies not just to memecoins or purposeless tokens, but even to legitimate projects with real innovation and flawed tokenomics.\n\n**My proposed solution:** A design that converts chaotic momentum into stable, gradual growth using math and a touch of community coordination.\n\n**Feasibility rationale:** Tokens like DAI prove that the power of math and community can stabilize the price of a coin and peg it to a value. We can apply the same principle power with a different design but **instead of a stabilized peg, a stabilized growth.**\n\nI have in mind a complete technical design and the ability to implement it, primarily in solidity (for eth or an eth based chain). It is completely trustless with no centralized control and includes a semi-DAO mechanism where users can collaborate and direct the assets backing their tokens into permissioned smart contracts so they can capitalize on the assets they control but can't force use the assets of others.\n\n**Key Features/Properties:**\n\n* Tokens acquired directly from the protocol can have a \"forever break-even liquidity\" while the price is algorithmically designed to grow at a stable pace.\n   * (For a CEX to utilize this feature they would have to integrate the smart contract interaction. People who spot trade it are exposed to financial loses).\n* Token-backing assets are not trapped and can be funneled for utilization .\n* Protocol users can vote/vouch.\n   * Protocol fees for yield.\n   * Growth parameters (within pre-limits).\n   * Prevent the release of team tokens.\n      * Don't like the team? Vote that they'd get nothing.\n   * Funnel funds to an external contract using a minimum threshold at deadline logic.\n* Verify onchain a statement they made. An immutable proof that they said what they said.\n* A complete fair launch with a given grace period to join at the base price before growth logic initiates.\n   * A genuinely benevolent trustless design. \"A token Coffeezilla would be proud of\".\n\n**Reasons for me not to do it:**\n\n* I lack marketing skills.\n* I lack visual design skills (I can do a practical UI but not a conventionally beautiful/attractive design).\n* UX may be complex.\n* Team disincentivized. My intent for a fair financial design may discourage potential collaborators.\n* Regulatory gray zone due big brother progress proroguing governments.\n* Hard work and effort that requires motivation I don't currently have.\n* \"Too Ethical for Degens\" In this market, many people want to gamble and see 100x returns within a few days, they don't appreciate steady appreciation and those who do lean toward Bitcoin and large blue chip coin.\n\n**Reason why it should be done:**\n\n* Addresses a Real Problem. Offers an innovative low risk financial opportunity that is brave enough to see beyond short term greed.\n* Innovative Tokenomics\n* Built-in Integrity. Potential collaboration with Tegridy Farms.\n* Realistic semi-DAO features. Community-driven, but without the overly complex systems that open the door to protocol-killing exploits.\n* A fair, trustless, ethical undertaking.\n* Could be fun\n* Could be profitable\n* Within my capabilities if I find the right support\n\n**Thoughts?**", "content_size_bytes": 3298}

I would appreciate any thoughts/ideas here, as I'm still not sure if it would actually work in practice. Thanks!\n\n**Delayed Proof-of-Work (DPoW)**\n\nA theoretical consensus mechanism for energy-efficient, time-regulated mining.\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1. A new block is added to the chain.\n2. All miners start computing a VDF (Verifiable Delay Function) with the latest block's hash as the input.\n3. The VDF is designed to take 4 minutes to complete, enforcing a mandatory idle period.\n4. The \\~1 minute mining period begins when miners complete the VDF.\n5. Miners compete to find a valid PoW for a new block, which includes the VDF output in the header.\n6. The first miner to find a valid hash broadcasts the new block to the network.\n7. The block is verified by nodes by checking the VDF's output is correct for the previous block hash, and that the PoW is valid.\n\nThis cycle of a 4 minute idle period and a brief mining period continues.\n\n**Key Advantages**:\n\n* The idle-mine cycle allows the network to operate with \\~1/5 of the hash power of a standard PoW blockchain while still taking advantage of the security properties of PoW.\n* During the 4 minute idle period, the blockchain is guaranteed to be static. The predictable delay means blocks are propagated and confirmed in a more synchronized fashion, which could reduce synchronization issues and orphaned blocks.\n\n**Potential Issues:**\n\n* VDFs can be computed slightly faster on hardware with higher clock speeds or specialized circuits, resulting in some miners having a longer mining period.\n* The short mining-window means that miners on faster connections will have a significant advantage over slower connections, as they will be able to propagate a mined block faster.\n* The VDF also uses energy, although negligible compared to the amount that algorithms use.\n* Miners might redirect their hash power to other cryptocurrencies during the delay period, which would undermine the goal of reducing energy consumption.\n* A malicious miner who obtains or predicts the next block could start precomputing the VDF early, gaining an unfair advantage.", "content_size_bytes": 2201}

The simplest way to think of it is as a standardized language that defines communication between the hardware and software.\n\nThough RISC-V was not originally built for blockchain purposes, its open design allowed crypto developers to leverage it for building virtual machines that could generate zero-knowledge proofs at far lower resource costs than the EVM.\n\nThe outcome is what’s known as a zero knowledge virtual machine (zkVM), which enables developers to write applications in high level languages like Rust without needing to be trained in cryptography.\n\nIn the absence of zkVMs, companies that want to leverage zk tech to build a privacy-secure application to process payroll/healthcare data would need to spend much more time writing custom zk circuits that cannot be easily changed after deployment (unlike a zkVM where devs could simply recompile RISC-V code).\n\nThoughts?", "content_size_bytes": 1568}

Please chime in to refine this. So, my project is using zero-knowledge proofs and I am finding out that people who are not familiar with the concept (and even those who think they are) are struggling to understand it. I came up with a story below to help non-technical and technical people understand how this would work on a blockchain.\n\nSo, here goes:\n\nJohn has $1,000 and needs to send $100 to Bill. Nobody can know the amounts that are being sent or how much money John or Bill has. \n\nLet's break this down.\n\n1. John owns $1,000.\n\nInstead of waving cash around, he seals the money inside a thick, light-proof envelope. Before he seals it, he presses a special wax stamp that embeds a cryptographic code tied to \"$1,000 + some random noise.\" That stamp is tamper-evident: anyone can scan it later and be certain nothing inside has been swapped, yet the scan reveals zero about the real amount.\n\nThe stamp fixes the value without exposing it.\n\n2. Splitting the funds - still in the dark.\n\nJohn now prepares two new opaque envelopes:\n\n\\- Envelope A (for Bill)  \n\\- Envelope B (change back to John)\n\nHe secretly puts $100 in A and $900 in B, adds fresh random noise to each, and presses a new wax stamp on both. Again, the stamps hide the figures but lock them in place.\n\n3. The referee's balance test.\n\nA neutral blockchain referee (software, not a person) receives only the three stamp codes, never the cash. With some clever math the referee checks two rules:\n\n\\- Conservation: \"Stamp(original) = Stamp(A) + Stamp(B)\"  \n\\- Range proof: each new envelope holds a non-negative amount (no hidden debt).\n\nBecause the math is homomorphic (computations can be performed without decryption), the referee can confirm both rules without peeling open any envelope.\n\nIf the equations hold, the referee signs a one-line certificate: \"John's transfer verified - no amounts disclosed.\"\n\nThat certificate (the zero-knowledge proof) is what gets written to the next block.\n\n4. What the world sees.\n\n\\- Everyone can audit the certificate and know the transaction is sound.  \n\\- Nobody learns that Envelope A contains $100, or even that Bill is receiving $100 instead of $5,000 or $42.  \n\\- The original and change amounts stay private, yet the ledger's arithmetic stays perfect.\n\nSummary:\n\nZero-knowledge proofs are like tamper-proof stamps on opaque envelopes: they let the blockchain confirm that John's $1,000 was correctly split into a payment and change without ever revealing how much cash sits inside each envelope.", "content_size_bytes": 2557}

Each NFT grants its holder a proportional share of the royalties generated by the song.

Additionally, I am not citing the name of my project, or trying to promote it in any way, just looking for advice from fellow developers.\n\n\n\nThat said, a little context. The distributed capability of blockchain tech is what originally drew me to the crypto space 10 or so years ago. I have always loved the concept of essentially using greed as a key motivator to create a secure and trustless asset. I find it inspiring, as fundamentally, no ecosystem can exist free of avarice, and historically, the accumulation of malefactors is what inevitably degrades the integrity of the system. Although far from perfect, the opportunities created by this technology seems to offer the closest function for turning the greed of potential bad actors into a positive force, by rewarding meritorious action such as mining, staking, and auditing, to such a degree that it disincentivizes defectors.\n\n\n\nLooking at what other issues that blockchain could potentially create merit based cooperation for universal good in, one of the biggest economic complaints that seems to constantly plague the world, regardless of nation, political affiliation, ect... is the poor management of inflation, leading to ever increasing escalation and instability of financial assets. Cryptocurrencies have already made inroads into this issue, such as with Bitcoin having a finite supply, and thus a deflationary trajectory, or in the case of dozens of cryptos that have regulated, transparent inflation rates.\n\n  \nIt occurred to me though that although many cryptocurrencies have decentralized consensus that controls one or more aspects of the tokens inflation / deflation, I cannot think of one that has put full control of both mechanisms into the hands of the token holders. There are clear reasons for this, and in many cases I can fully understand why the developers would not want to risk bad actors having any part of their tokens minting and burning rates, nor is it appropriate most of the time. \n\n\n\nStill, the idea is intriguing, for, if given the opportunity, would a community of token holders be capable of self regulating the use of inflationary and deflationary mechanisms, ultimately working together to build the ecosystems financial value and stability, or, would short term greed and \"pump and dump\" malefactors overwhelm the system and cause a total loss of stability?\n\n  \nPersonally I find the concept to be fascinating, so out of curiosity, a little over a year ago, I started building a token model to test this socioeconomic theory, as well as my own programming ability. Since then I have gone through several revisions, with my first few concept designs falling apart almost immediately do to architecture flaws, exorbitant on-chain fees, extreme transaction latency, and issues incorporating off-chain entities. However, about a year later and I have created what I am confident is a functional and working prototype to test my thesis, building my model using the EIP-2535 standard, with independent facets for the inflationary and deflationary modules that can be activated and deactivated via a staked voting mechanism by token holders, and with certain mechanisms, once activated, relying on off-chain entities via a ZK Rollup to handle computations to cut gas fees, with off-chain \"nodes\" handling the off-chain computations, and incentivized through the ability to host and profit from staked tokens to their nodes. Bad actors can be penalized for trying to use a node to send corrupted information by quarantining of the effected node, and both node operators and token holders are incentivized to partake in voting by the direct impact on the total supply of the token. In order to ensure that the token is not pushed to a unsustainable supply in either direction, the supply is \"rubber-banded\", ensuring that the further the supply gets from the initial supply, the more difficult activating and maintaining the supporting mechanisms will become.\n\n\n\n It was particularly challenging, as prior to this project I have never worked with either the EIP-2535 standard or ZK Rollups, and I stumbled more then I would like to admit.\n\n  \nAll of this is to say, I am looking for input, criticism, and questions that can help me hunt down any remaining flaws that I may have been to close to the project to see, prior to its launch. Shortly after I first started this project, I posted an inquiry here about potential mechanisms to integrate into the token, and some of the responses I got were quite inspired. I am hoping that this post may evoke some similar insights.\n\nThank you for your time reading this, and for your responses if you are so inclined.", "content_size_bytes": 4870}

But a closer look at how eth_decrypt functioned reveals cracks in this reasoning, suggesting the decision might mask a deeper motive.\n\nHere’s how it worked: eth_decrypt and eth_getEncryptionPublicKey relied on asymmetric encryption. A third party could use eth_getEncryptionPublicKey to fetch a user’s public encryption key, derived from their Ethereum private key (ECDSA on secp256k1). They could then encrypt data—potentially vast amounts—using this key, e.g. via ECIES (Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme). The wallet owner would decrypt it with eth_decrypt, using the same private key that signs transactions (e.g., via eth_signTypedData_v4). MetaMask argued that this dual use could expose the private key, risking account security\n\nBut this doesn’t hold up under scrutiny. In asymmetric encryption, the public key is meant to be shared—encrypting millions of messages with it doesn’t inherently compromise the private key, provided the scheme (like ECIES) is secure with proper nonce usage and authentication. Decryption with the private key is distinct from signing; it doesn’t generate a public output like a signature does, so the \"same key\" risk feels overstated. True vulnerabilities—like padding oracle attacks or side-channel leaks—would stem from implementation flaws, not the concept itself. Yet MetaMask’s 2023 blog post admitted no known exploits existed. If the risk was theoretical, why axe a feature that enabled private on-chain communication\n\nThe \"same key\" argument fits symmetric encryption better, where one key handles both encryption and decryption, amplifying misuse risks. But eth_decrypt was asymmetric, making the justification seem misapplied. MetaMask pledged support for a new encryption standard, like EIP-5630 (proposed in 2022 for safer key derivation via eth_performECDH), but as of April 2025, it’s still unfinished, leaving developers in the lurch.

They will stop only once the total cost of production equals the total block reward (i.e. when marginal profit == 0)\n\nHowever, not all PoW protocols are as maximally energy-inefficient as Nakamoto Consensus. Some PoW protocols reduce waste and redundancy from uncle and orphaned blocks by reusing normally-discarded blocks.\n\n**TL;DR**:\n\n* **PoW Longest-chain**: Makes blocks expensive to produce with constant difficulty adjustments. All effort is discarded/wasted except for blocks produced in the longest-chain. Has weak economic security incentives. Weak to 51% attacks.\n* **PoW DAG**: Makes blocks cheap to produce. Accepts all valid blocks without discarding. Has moderate economic security incentives, but weak spam-protection. Strong against safety-type 51% attacks, but weak against liveness attacks.\n* **PoW GHOSTDAG**: Makes blocks cheap to produce. Accepts nearly all valid transactions. Has moderately-strong economic security incentives. Strong against safety-type 51% attacks, and moderately-strong against liveness attacks.\n* **PoS DAG**: Makes blocks cheap to produce. Accepts all valid blocks without discarding. Has strong economic security for both safety and liveness.\n\n-------------------------------\n\n**Longest-chain is an Energy-spending maximizer**\n\nBitcoin's longest-chain/heaviest-weight is a family of consensus protocols that maximizes energy-spending (and e-waste production) until the marginal profit reaches zero. It will stop only when the cost of production exceeds the security budget from its block rewards.\n\nEven as mining rigs become more efficient at producing SHA256 hashes (CPU -> GPU -> ASIC -> faster ASIC), the never-ending difficulty adjustments completely nullify that efficiency increase.\n\nThere is major miner misalignment of economic incentive under longest-chain because those providing security (miners) do not have the same goals as those receiving the security (holders).\n\n**Is it possible to design a PoW protocol that is less wasteful?**\n\nThe main problem with longest-chain is that it wastes computations. Everyone is trying to build a block, but everyone's efforts get thrown out while only the winner's block is accepted. One way to decrease wastefulness is to not discard effort. There is a way to use discarded blocks under which is to use other consensus protocols like DAGs and GHOSTDAG.\n\n**What is a DAG, and why is it more efficient and more secure?**\n\nA DAG is another category of Distributed Ledger Technologies (blockchains are also DLTs), that has a mesh-like structure instead of a linear chain of blocks (e.g. blockchain). All valid blocks are accepted, and none are thrown away unless they're invalid or have bad signatures. Thus nothing gets wasted. Blocks are connected to each other like a mesh and ordered based on time-equivalents. Nano and the original IOTA (it later upgraded to PoS) are both PoW DAGs, and they're both extremely efficient.\n\nComputations are not wasted, and there doesn't need to be a constant difficulty adjustment. Blocks are constantly being produced at low cost (sub-pennies) and high throughput (thousands of TPS).\n\nIn addition, longest-chain protocol is weak to 51% attacks, especially when block production is slow and there is a pool of transactions waiting to be added (a mempool). When block production is fast and the pool is usually empty, reorg and censorship attacks from 51% attacks become largely irrelevant. Sure, blocks can be reorged or censored, but the throughput is so high that transactions get added anyways by other miners seconds after the attack. So the attack only affects other miner's block rewards, which are mostly insignificant anyways. This nearly nullifies the effectiveness of 51% attacks.\n\nTechnically, there is no mining for adding transactions. The mining is mainly for spam-prevention, which is an issue I will cover later.\n\n**What is the GHOSTDAG consensus protocol?**\n\nGHOSTDAG is a portmanteau of GHOST (Greedy Heaviest Observed SubTree, Ethereum's original PoW protocol) and DAG.\n\nLongest-chain protocol throws away blocks that are not in the longest-chain. Those discarded blocks are called uncle or orphaned blocks. GHOST uses uncle and orphaned blocks as part of the weight calculations for determining the heaviest-chain, which makes it more secure and efficient than vanilla longest-chain.\n\nGHOSTDAG goes a step further than GHOST. There are 2 versions of this. One version includes orphaned blocks into the chain in a pseudo-DAG-like manner. The other option discards the blocks, but includes the transactions from those discarded blocks as long as they're valid. Either way, computations are not being wasted. They have the same benefits as a DAG.\n\nUnlike with Nano's version of a DAG, GHOSTDAG (Kaspa's previous consensus protocol) has actual mining, which is mainly used for both spam-prevention and for security.\n\n**What's the downside with DAGs?**\n\nThere's always a tradeoff. For DAGs with high throughput, it's spam.\n\nLongest-chain's ultimate goal is to maximize energy-spending (and e-waste production) until the block reward is expended. DAG's goal is to maximize block production until transaction demand is fully-met.\n\nDAGs are so fast and efficient at producing blocks that they can become extremely spammy and sometimes have issues with liveness.\n\nNano had this problem because it went to the extreme of having no fees. Everyone was a miner, and everyone was constantly producing blocks. This leads to storage bloat and increased node/RPC hardware requirements. Mining was practically costless, but full nodes were not being compensated for storing the full ledger, and ledgers can grow very quickly when throughput is high.\n\nThus DAGs need some kind of process to reduce spam. Nano adds a small Proof of Work mechanism to combat spam, but they probably didn't go far enough. Nodes/RPCs are still not being compensated, and they're partially responsible for security. GHOSTDAG improves on this by requiring miners and a transaction fee paid to miners. This lessens the burden for security on uncompensated nodes and shifts it to the miners.\n\nSo it's possible to produce a partially secure, safe, and efficient PoW by using DAGs or GHOSTDAGs. There is still some minor/miner misalignment of economic incentive because under PoW, those providing security do not have the same economic incentives as those receiving security.\n\n**PoS DAGs**\n\nGoing one step further ...\n\nA PoS DAG protocol is even more secure. On top of all the benefits of DAGs, now validators are economically-compensated for providing security, and they have economic incentive to provide security, so the interest of those providing security and those receiving security are aligned.", "content_size_bytes": 6956}

There have been plenty of PoW blockchains with smaller security budgets that have been ruined by 51% attacks, which led to large reorgs or double-spends. Historically, Bitcoin's security budget has increased between each cycle, but this increase has been decreasing from the start, and has now reached an inflection point. Transaction fees on average still only cover 1% of the block reward and are completely insufficient to cover for Bitcoin's security.\n\nAs of March 2025, Bitcoin security budget, when CPI-adjusted, has **declined over 45%** in real value compared to 4 years ago (sources: \"Miners Revenue\" from Blockchain.com, CPI data from St. Louis FRED).\n\nThere is a well-studied, recent research paper covering this long-term systemic risk to Bitcoin:\n\n**\"The Imminent (and Avoidable) Security Risk of Bitcoin Halving\"** - https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4801113\n\t\nThis research paper from Apr 2024 analyzes the long-term effects of Bitcoin halvings on Bitcoin's security budget and Bitcoin's security.\n\nDue to the halvings, Bitcoin's security relative to the amount being protected (aka the \"security budget ratio\") roughly halves every 4 years. Transactions fees have not been rising enough to make up for the loss in block subsidy. In fact, transaction fees on average still only cover 1% of the total block subsidy. The Cost of Attack (CoA) on Bitcoin is expected to continue declining in the long run.\n\n####**The researchers identify many major long-term issues for Bitcoin's security model**:\n\n* **Misaligned security incentives**: Bitcoin miners are profit-driven. Unlike with PoS, Bitcoin miners do not have strong economic incentive to protect Bitcoin when mining is no longer profitable. There is economic loss in protecting Bitcoin against a strong 51% attacker.\n* **Declining security budget ratio**: The \"widening divergence between the decreasing security budget and the rising total value of Bitcoin has been identified as a substantial long-term security problem\".\n* **Price instabilities**: \"can push mining activity far below its equilibrium value\" where \"the hash rate required by a 51% attacker is substantially reduced\"\n* **Secondary markets from unprofitable mining**: \"In our default scenario, the 28% of miners that become unprofitable in post-halving equilibrium may be willing to sell their hardware. Then an attacker who aims to acquire 50% of the total hash rate could buy this cheap hardware.\"\n* **Cost of Attack**: Was previously expected to be $5-20B in mining equipment, but possibly much cheaper due to secondary markets. Ongoing cost is $100M/day cost for maintaining a 51% attack.\n* **Timing attacks**: Due to difficulty adjustments around halvings, the total hash rates can be up to three times lower than before the halving, making Bitcoin 3x easier to 51% attack.\n* **Insufficient Transaction Fees**: Transaction fees on average have not risen at all, and are too low to cover for the loss in block subsidy from halvings\n* **Goldfinger attacks**: \"Stakeholders with intentions to undermine Bitcoin or profit from short positions may actively engage in Goldfinger attacks\"\n\nNote that the researchers based their figures on S9 ASIC miners since those are readily available on secondary markets. The CoA using newer S19 and S21 miners should be even cheaper by up to 3x because they are much more efficient.\n\n####**Possible solutions**\n\nThe authors recommend several solutions, all of which require controversial hard forks.\n\n* Removing supply cap and having permanent block subsidy issuance\n* Imposing minimum mandatory transaction fees\n* Switching to other more secure consensus protocols (like PoS)\n* Using a gradual inflation-reduction curve to eliminate sudden shocks in mining drops from halvings\n* Implementing a smaller max difficulty-adjustment\n\nTheir primary recommendation is to remove the supply cap and allow for permanent sustainable block subsidy issuance.

This wasn’t a novel idea on my part, of course, but from what I’ve gathered based on a quick Google search, it seems like most of the discussion around this topic has been around the use of blockchain technologies to create a complete, end-to-end voting system that would completely replace our current voting system.  From what I can tell, though, it seems like there may be some significant vulnerabilities associated with blockchain voting systems (fraud, manipulation/exploitation, etc.) that would need to be addressed before the blockchain could be taken seriously as a viable option to completely replace our existing voting systems, ya?  \n\nWhat I’m wondering, though, without getting into any of the details of how a potential blockchain system that’s similar to what I’m envisioning would actually operate, I’m curious if there are any potential practical applications to use blockchain technologies to create some sort of separate but parallel system (as opposed to a system that would completely replace the existing voting system) that could help support/substantiate the results of a free and fair election… Or that - in the event that there had been widespread election fraud/interference - could at least provide some sort of initial indication that there had been so that there would at least be some justification for there to be some type of additional audit process and/or investigation to ensure that the election had indeed been fair and free.  \n\nTruthfully, though, I don’t really know too much about how our current voting system in the US functions, and even less about crypto and blockchain technologies, unfortunately.  So… with that disclosure out of the way, I guess I’d like to know if there would be any value in creating a blockchain system that could provide a real time “shadow count” of the votes that are being cast during an election, whereby individual users would be able to submit their “digital ballot” to the blockchain, which would allow the system to keep real time vote counts based on each individual user’s voting district.  The rationale being that if the official vote tally were to deviate significantly from the blockchain’s vote count (or vote ratio, at least), then that might be a red flag for society at least to look into the matter a bit more closely, perhaps?  And also, another potential function/feature of this system might be for there to be a means by which, once the official ballots had finally been counted, users could check and verify that their official ballot had been processed correctly and that the votes on their official ballot aligned with the votes that they’d included on their digital/blockchain ballot, and if there were some sort of discrepancy, users could report or flag it somehow through the blockchain so that it would be possible to identify any instances in which there appeared to be an inordinate amount of flags/reports in a particular area/district that may have been associated with some sort of election interference, perhaps?  \n\nAnyways, I’m sure that there’s a million potential issues that I’m not even considering here and it’s also very possible that this is a dumb idea that’s not even worth responding to, but in the off chance that there’s some kind and knowledgeable Redditor out there who’s willing to indulge my curiosity, I figured I might as well ask.  So, yeah, what do you think?  What sorts of things would I need to consider if I were to create such a system?  Major obstacles in developing and/or maintaining it?  Major limitations?  I appreciate any information you might have to offer on this topic since I (obviously) know very little!  Excited to read your responses!  Thanks, y’all! \n", "content_size_bytes": 3885}

Obviously, at the end of it, even though the source code is available on GitHub  and open source, that doesn't matter one bit, as someone is still taking this code and running the build scripts and then publishing the new version to the app store.\n\nThere is nothing stopping said individual from making some uncommitted changes locally before building and releasing a new version of the app (so not visible publicly on GitHub, etc.). These changes could purposefully introduce any number of malicious behaviours into the app, such as 1) deterministic private key generation for new wallets or 2) an inconspicuous private key logging mechanism or 3) have all transaction signing simply send to addresses that this individual owns. Effectively draining users' funds until people realize and the app gets rolled back or taken down. Even an hour of time with a malicious version out there is enough to cause significant financial loss.\n\nThis is my biggest fear with hot wallets. The more popular they get, and the more people are using them to store a large amount of bitcoin, cumulatively, the more tempting this becomes to the individual with the ability to roll out app updates. It just needs to get into the wrong hands.\n\nSome ways in which this could be mitigated:\n\n1. If Apple would allow users to disable automatic updates only for certain individual apps (such as hot wallets for example), and if they would allow checksum verifications with source code in some way, then the user could update to a new version on their own once they verify and audit the code themselves, or allow time to pass for others in the community to do so, etc.\n2. If I somehow knew that Apple placed an extreme level of scrutiny for certain app updates, such as hot wallets, then this would at least be something.. But I truly have no idea if they apply any more rigor when reviewing actual code changes of hot wallets vs some random game.\n\nOr perhaps I am missing something and this is well protected against?

I am currently taking a course regarding blockchain technology and my professor has us following along the Princeton Book on \"Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies\".\n\n[https://d28rh4a8wq0iu5.cloudfront.net/bitcointech/readings/princeton\\_bitcoin\\_book.pdf](https://d28rh4a8wq0iu5.cloudfront.net/bitcointech/readings/princeton_bitcoin_book.pdf)   (page 34-36)\n\nHere is a youtube video covering the very same material:\n\n[https://youtu.be/fOMVZXLjKYo?si=oTFDviBG\\_Pj51EJb&t=1487](https://youtu.be/fOMVZXLjKYo?si=oTFDviBG_Pj51EJb&t=1487)\n\nNow I am taking issue with the Merkle Tree explanation provided in this book. However to question material provided by Princeton would seem inconceivable. So I would like to ask this subreddit for clarification before I make a fool of myself in front of my professor. But I genuinely understand this book to be misrepresenting the merkle tree structure. I would APPRECIATE your feedback to my post and let me know what you think. Have I misunderstood something? Is the book making an error?\n\nOk, on to the material. Here is a direct quote from the book.\n\n>Suppose we have a number of blocks containing data. These blocks comprise the leaves of our tree. We group these data blocks into pairs of two, and then for each pair, we build a data structure that has two hash pointers, one to each of these blocks. These data structures make the next level up of the tree. We in turn group these into groups of two, and for each pair, create a new data structure that contains the hash of each. We continue doing this until we reach a single block, the root of the tree.\n\nHere is a corresponding figure presenting a merkle tree structure from the book:\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/UnpEjqJ.png](https://i.imgur.com/UnpEjqJ.png)\n\nREBUTTAL:\n\nThe specific grievance is:\n\n>we build a data structure that has two hash pointers, one to each of these blocks.\n\nI claim this is not the case(with sources provided later). I claim the data structure(parent node) that is made for each pair contains the hash of the concatenation of the children. So if there is a pair of leaves A and B, the parent node does NOT contain two hash pointers for each leaf which is written as H(A) H(B) in the book's diagram. Instead, it contains a single hash of both A and B concatenated, that is  denoted as H(A||B).\n\nFurther, there are no pointers which let you instantly hop from the parent to its children. The only way to find the child given a parent in practice is by using index arithmetic because all of the nodes in a binary tree can be denoted using indexing. And indexing follows a structure that lets you navigate the tree.\n\nI claim the above misunderstanding leads to a further misunderstanding regarding a proof of membership. As I understand, a proof of membership is the same as a proof of inclusion and a merkle proof.\n\nHere is the text from the book:\n\n>Proof of membership. Another nice feature of Merkle trees is that, unlike the block chain that we built before, it allows a concise proof of membership. Say that someone wants to prove that a certain data block is a member of the Merkle Tree. As usual, we remember just the root. Then they need to show us this data block, and the blocks on the path from the data block to the root. We can ignore the rest of the tree, as the blocks on this path are enough to allow us to verify the hashes all the way up to the root of the tree. See Figure 1.8 for a graphical depiction of how this works.\n\nHere is a diagram they provide:\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/A5KKDJO.png](https://i.imgur.com/A5KKDJO.png)\n\nREBUTTAL: Consider a trivial example of a merkle tree where it contains 3 nodes.  It has a root. The root has 2 children(leaf nodes in this case). Also assume a merkle tree is structured as I claim: The leaf nodes contain hashes of their corresponding datablocks. The parents of these leaf nodes contain the hash of the concatenated child hashes. And any further parents are recursively constructed in the same fashion.\n\nGiven this simple case, let the datablocks be denoted as A and B. Then one leaf node contains H(A) and the other contains H(B). The parent contains the hash H( H(A) || H(B) ).\n\nI want to prove the membership of the datablock A. The book claims I need only provide the direct path from root to leaf node of A. And I claim this is NOT enough information. Suppose I do as the book states and provide the root and the leaf node containing H(A). First providing the leaf node H(A) is actually redundant. Anyone can fabricate the correct hash of a datablock on the fly. What we really want is a piece of information that confirms H(A) is indeed part of this tree where the hashes propagate upward to the root - and where the root is combined authenticator for all the elements in the tree. Ok so maybe adding the root will provide enough information? If I observe the hash stored in the root which is the output of H(H(A)||H(B)). Well this is NOT helpful! How can I confirm that H(A) was propagated upwards into the root and passed into a hash with H(B) concatenated. I have H(A), but I'm missing half of the input so how can I possibly reproduce the output of H(H(A)||H(B)) to verify? The only way to verify would be if I was provided H(B).\n\nI claim the information that must be provided are the sibling nodes along the direct route from leaf to root which contradicts the claims in the book.\n\nSOURCES\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/hA7fAzL.png](https://i.imgur.com/hA7fAzL.png)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/a4d6Z3h.png](https://i.imgur.com/a4d6Z3h.png)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/CmDs8tg.png](https://i.imgur.com/CmDs8tg.png)\n\n[https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/\\~raluca/cs261-f15/readings/merkleodb.pdf](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~raluca/cs261-f15/readings/merkleodb.pdf)\n\n======================\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/Tj8XEex.png](https://i.imgur.com/Tj8XEex.png)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/TSrdJaA.png](https://i.imgur.com/TSrdJaA.png)\n\n[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.07941](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.07941)\n\n======================\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/cLiRDAe.png](https://i.imgur.com/cLiRDAe.png)  \n[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2096720922000343](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2096720922000343)\n\n======================\n\nThe section on k-ary merkle trees puts further emphasis on the sibling requirements because the number of siblings grows with k.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/KRFxhTC.png](https://i.imgur.com/KRFxhTC.png)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/JgQ3Pvu.png](https://i.imgur.com/JgQ3Pvu.png)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/o0sZmGV.png](https://i.imgur.com/o0sZmGV.png)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/YoRIfxw.png](https://i.imgur.com/YoRIfxw.png)\n\n[https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/materials/2018/Kuszmaul.pdf](https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/materials/2018/Kuszmaul.pdf)\n\n======================\n\nHere is a merkle tree implementation and the getProof method demonstrates the siblings are returned AND it uses index arithmetic to locate the siblings rather than a \"hash pointer\" as described in book.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/3Nm7Mjg.png](https://i.imgur.com/3Nm7Mjg.png)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/mqOpYFB.png](https://i.imgur.com/mqOpYFB.png)\n\n[https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/merkle-tree/blob/master/src/core.ts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/merkle-tree/blob/master/src/core.ts)\n\n======================\n\nThis is a response to a question about how the merkle proof works and they walk through the steps pretty clearly with an actual example using hashes.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/icda30h.png](https://i.imgur.com/icda30h.png)\n\n[https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/69018/merkle-root-and-merkle-proofs](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/69018/merkle-root-and-merkle-proofs)", "content_size_bytes": 7693}

It’s like a stock market for real-world events.\n\n# Why does this matter for crypto?\n\n* They’re actually useful – Instead of just trading meme coins, prediction markets provide real-world value by showing what people *really* think will happen.\n* Less censorship – A lot of places ban certain types of betting (especially political betting), but decentralized markets are harder to shut down.\n* One of the best real uses for crypto – People always ask what crypto is actually *good for*. This is one of the best answers.\n* Better than traditional betting – No middlemen, lower fees, and the odds are set by the market instead of bookies.\n\nPlatforms like Polymarket and Augur are already doing this, but it still feels early.

This process is **energy-intensive** and relatively **slow**.\n* **XRP (Ripple)**: Uses the **Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm (RPCA)**, which relies on a network of **trusted validators (Will talk about these later)** to reach consensus on transactions. It is **faster**, more **energy-efficient**, and does not require mining.\n\n  \n**Transaction Speed**:\n\n* **Bitcoin**: **10 minutes** on average due to the time required to mine each block.\n* **XRP**:  **3-5 seconds** due to its lightweight consensus algorithm. Very fast.\n\n  \n**Scalability (TPS-wise)**:\n\n* **Bitcoin**: Processes about **7 transactions per second (TPS)**. Scaling has been a challenge due to its block size and consensus model (?)\n* **XRP**: Can handle up to **1,500 TPS**, making it more suitable for large-scale, high-frequency use cases like global payments.\n\n  \n**Purpose**:\n\n* **Bitcoin**: Designed as a **decentralized digital currency** and store of value, often referred to as \"digital gold.\"\n* **XRP**: Primarily developed as a **bridge currency** for cross-border payments and facilitating fast, low-cost transfers between financial institutions.\n\n# Combined Benefits for Financial Technology:\n\n1. **Improved Efficiency**: Bitcoin’s decentralization and XRP’s speed/low cost can complement each other in creating hybrid systems that are both secure and scalable.\n2. **Reduced Costs**: Both cryptocurrencies eliminate the need for traditional intermediaries, reducing inefficiencies in transaction and operational costs between countries.\n3. **Innovation in Payment Systems**: By integrating blockchain technology, Bitcoin and XRP can inspire new solutions for digital payments, lending, and \"**ASSET\"** tokenization.\n\n  \nSome questions that I have:\n\n1. Can both co-exist with each other later?  \n2. Is XRP decentralized or centralized?  \n\n* Validators on the XRP Ledger include universities, financial institutions, and independent organizations, making the network less reliant on Ripple Labs.\n* Since Ripple Labs created XRP and still holds a significant portion of its supply (over 40 billion XRP in escrow). This concentration of ownership can give Ripple Labs significant influence over the XRP market, defeat the purpose of decentralized currency like bitcoin.\n\n  \nPlease correct me if I have any mistakes and I hope we could learn from each other :) Thank you!", "content_size_bytes": 2954}

The core idea of this algorithm is to enhance both transaction confidentiality and user anonymity without compromising the integrity of the blockchain itself. This is achieved primarily through the use of pseudonyms for each transaction, and I'd love to explain how it works!\n\nKey Features:\n\n1. Pseudonyms for Sender and Receiver:\nEvery transaction on the blockchain involves a pseudo-generated public address for both the sender and the receiver. These pseudonyms are essentially temporary identities tied to a private key that can only be used for that specific transaction. By doing so, the blockchain ensures that there is no direct link between the user’s real-world identity and their on-chain activities, enhancing privacy.\n\n2. Transaction Fragmentation:\nTransactions are fragmented into smaller parts that are independently validated, meaning that even if parts of the transaction are intercepted, it becomes nearly impossible to reconstruct the full transaction. This ensures extra layers of security and privacy.\n\n3. Dual Validation by Two Groups of Miners:\nTo further enhance security, two separate groups of miners validate different aspects of each transaction. This reduces the risk of malicious actions and ensures that the integrity of the transaction is always maintained.\n\n4. Cryptographic Protections:\nI’ve incorporated zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), ring signatures, and other advanced cryptographic techniques to guarantee that transaction details remain private while still allowing for secure verification on the blockchain.\n\nWhy Pseudonyms?\n\nThe use of pseudonyms in this system allows for complete privacy—even when transactions are verified, there is no way to trace back the transaction to any real-world identity unless the user explicitly reveals it. This is a key feature for anyone concerned with maintaining their privacy in a blockchain environment.\n\nAdditionally, it provides a layer of security against tracking and surveillance by making it incredibly difficult to correlate transactions between different pseudonyms, even if they are used by the same person.\n\nWhat’s Next?\n\nI’m hoping to take this concept further and eventually bring it to the real world. The system is designed to be scalable, meaning it can grow alongside the adoption of blockchain technology while maintaining privacy and security for all users.\n\nIf you’re into blockchain tech, privacy, or cryptography, I’d love to hear your thoughts and any feedback you might have!\n\n\nThis blockchain algorithm uses pseudonyms for both sender and receiver, transaction fragmentation, and dual miner validation to ensure maximum privacy and security while maintaining a transparent and secure blockchain ledger.", "content_size_bytes": 2854}

The ones that do will probably only play a minor role in the future of finance. There’s a lot to say so I’ll focus on what I see as the fundamental issue: **trustless and decentralized financial systems, no matter how well-engineered, fail to meet basic user needs.**\n\nCrypto overlooks the need for **oversight and intervention**. Without it, systems become dangerously exploitable. Crypto wallets often lack government IDs and use irreversible, sometimes untraceable transactions, making them prime targets for theft. As adoption grows, so might scams, threats, and violence. Without oversight, crypto can also be used to hide and launder money, promoting tax fraud and other criminal behavior.\n\nTraditional bank accounts, in contrast, incorporate measures like withdrawal limits, fraud detection, transaction traceability and reversibility, and compliance checks (KYC and AML). These safeguards require centralized authorities with power and thus DeFi lacks foundational security.\n\nSome argue that crime is minimal relative to total crypto transactions. Yet crypto grants users the freedom to commit these crimes if they choose, and the ease of doing so could incentivize tax fraud and other crimes. So while I admit privacy is important, your actions can’t be totally anonymous. Crypto is akin to having no police in a city.\n\nUsers are also fully responsible for their private keys, and that responsibility often leads to lost or accidentally destroyed wallets. Proper storage means creating multiple backups and maintaining a highly secure physical environment—no small task, especially when millions of dollars could be on the line. For most people, it simply isn’t practical or safe to manage that level of risk themselves. The sensible solution, in my view, is to rely on a centralized, trustworthy entity—i.e., a bank.\n\nHopefully, this illustrates the flaws in DeFi and why banks and governments remain necessary. For those who still believe a trustless blockchain is the solution where users bank themselves, remember that today’s “trustless” blockchains aren’t truly trustless. Oracles—offchain data sources that link onchain—cannot be verified cryptographically. While aggregation from multiple oracles can reduce risk, collusion remains possible.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is that **trust is indispensable, despite its imperfections.** Instead of eliminating trust, we should focus on making our institutions more trustworthy—a far simpler approach. To replace TradFi, crypto would need to replicate thousands of centralized features in code—fraud resolution, asset recovery, tax compliance, oracle verification, criminal law, and more. This would require an enormous infrastructure of decentralized nodes running millions of lines bug-free code, making complex, nuanced decisions—well beyond current technology. And since “code is law,” human intervention would be nearly impossible when mistakes occur.\n\nMaybe once we reach AGI, decentralized altruistic AI agents could run the financial system. Until then, I remain skeptical that most cryptocurrencies have any real, lasting value.\n\nEDIT: I wrote this post right before learning that OpenAI announced o3, which some say is AGI 🙊 \n\nThere’s a lot I didn’t say because this is long enough but I think there is some good in blockchain via taking elements of it and applying them to centralized, permissioned systems. That would give us the best of both worlds. Happy to engage with you all in the comments :) Also I used ChatGPT to polish this just a lil bit.", "content_size_bytes": 3745}

Can anyone here help? These mostly relate to scaling.\n\n1. We all know that multiple copies of the complete chain are held on mutiple machines (some explanations say \"by every device participating in the chain\" although I suspect thst is not really the case!) So, my first area of interest is the size of the chain / data storage requirements. I have no idea how much disk space a single block takes up, but that is largely irellevant. If a particular chain is old and popular, surely it wil evenbtually grow to a size that makes it impractical? Can anyone comment?\n2. The classic explanation of how a cryptocurrency works, is that the chain represents a ledger of all transactions. In order to figure out a particular address's balance (to see if they have enough to make a transaction) the explanation then basically states that the whole chain / ledger is scanned for transactions involving that address to calculate the balance. So, related to Q1, how is that done efficiently? I mean, if I have a chain that is (say) 10 years old, with several tens of billions of transactions in the ledger, wouldn't searching the chain for every transaction involving a particular address take an impractical amount of time? (Say, I have a waller running on my smartphone, how can it perform that search efficiently?) Or is there some clever algorithm in play here?\n3. How is the \"winning\" miner decided upon? Regardless of \"proof\" somehow one entitly must \"win\", sign the block, add it to the chain and claim the reward? Again, say we have several thousand miners (and nodes) it's not unreasonable for more thsan one to get a solution before consensus can be reached. Given that the whole point is to have no central control, who gets to decide? Doesn't network latency get in the way?\n4. I have a basic understanding of \"Proof of Work\" and how thi has led to a crazy amount of power being used on a glovbal scale for mining operations, but how do other systems work (\"Proof of Stake\" / \"Proof of Storage\" etc.) and why are they more efficient? Do they also not have to \"solve\" the block in the same way that PoW systems do?\n5. Who actaully executes smart contracts? By which I mean, where is the code actually run? Is it the miner?

I’m guessing that a quantum computer could calculate the target hash much faster than all the traditional computer on the network so the difficulty of the target hash would need to increase to maintain the 10 minute block target.\n\nIf my assumptions about the process above are correct (feel free to correct if I am misunderstanding), I’m curious what would happen to Bitcoin if this quantum computer stopped mining. Would the block creation process come to a halt since the traditional computers remaining on the network would not be able to calculate a hash of such difficulty?", "content_size_bytes": 886}

The idea is an escrow platform where:\n\n1. **Sellers submit a decryption key** to the escrow system.\n2. Buyers negotiate a deal (likely on a third-party platform).\n3. Once payment is confirmed, the decryption key is securely released to the buyer.\n4. The platform includes a **rating system** for buyers and sellers to build trust.\n\nKey Features:\n\n* No files or documents are stored on the site. Only a decryption key for said item.\n* Even if I wanted to investigate what’s being bought or sold, I wouldn’t be able to, since the files and transactions are separate. So 100% anon.\n* The system relies entirely on the **validity of the key** and the buyer’s ability to decrypt their file.\n\n# My Concerns:\n\nI’m worried there might not be enough demand for a system like this. It seems like there are limited use cases where total anonymity is essential.\n\n* Do you think this is a dumb idea?\n* Are there specific use cases or scenarios where this would make sense?\n* What would make you trust such a platform?\n\nSay you want to buy a digital good (e.g., a license key, encrypted document, or script) in complete privacy. The seller won’t just send it to you because they can’t be sure you’ll pay. That’s where our site comes in:\n\nThe seller encrypts the digital good and submits the **decryption key** to our site. The actual encrypted file remains wherever they choose—Dropbox, a USB stick, email—completely outside our platform. Once you’ve sent payment and it’s confirmed, the system releases the decryption key to you. You can then use the decryption key, on the encrypted file inorder to recieve your product.\n\n1. **Trust**: The seller is guaranteed payment, and you’re guaranteed the decryption key.\n2. **Anonymity**: Since we never handle or store the file, even we couldn’t determine what’s being bought or sold.\n3. **Security**: The process is entirely focused on the key, leaving the file’s storage up to the buyer and seller.\n\nOnly thing missing is the buyer needs to trust the seller, this I would use a rating/comment system for.\n\n  \nI’d really appreciate any constructive feedback or suggestions.

While Filecoin has made huge strides in the decentralized storage space, Cere Network’s Decentralized Data Cloud (DDC) offers some unique advantages that I believe could make it a more scalable, private, and efficient alternative in the long term. Here’s why:\n\n1. True Decentralization:\n\n\t•\tFilecoin operates with a reliance on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), which, while a powerful tool, still has issues around centralized bottlenecks—specifically, reliance on specific nodes for data retrieval. Cere Network is building its own decentralized storage layer, aiming for seamless on-chain data management, ensuring true decentralization without these limitations.\n\n2. Optimized for Scalability & Speed:\n\n\t•\tWhile Filecoin is good for long-term data storage, it struggles with real-time, high-speed data access, which is essential for Web3 applications and especially AI-driven projects. Cere’s DDC is engineered for high-throughput and low-latency access, enabling not just storage but real-time data sharing that’s critical for modern applications.\n\n3. Privacy-Focused for Enterprises and AI:\n\n\t•\tCere offers a far more robust approach for enterprises looking to securely share and manage sensitive data, whereas Filecoin lacks the same level of privacy integration. With data privacy becoming an even bigger issue, especially in AI development, Cere’s architecture allows secure data sharing, which is vital for the next-generation Web3 applications and AI algorithms.\n\nThe AI Angle & Potential Data Marketplace:\n\nOne of the most exciting aspects of Cere Network’s infrastructure is its potential to create a decentralized data marketplace. This could be a game-changer, especially as machine learning and AI continue to grow exponentially. Here’s how:\n\t1.\tDecentralized Data for AI Training:\nCere’s Decentralized Data Cloud (DDC) could be the foundation for a marketplace where custom datasets are bought and sold. AI models need massive, high-quality datasets to train on, but often, acquiring these datasets in a decentralized manner is complex and expensive. Cere Network could allow individuals or companies to upload, sell, or share their data securely, creating a new market for customized datasets that can be directly accessed by AI developers and machine learning practitioners.\n\t2.\tAccess to High-Quality Data for Machine Learning:\nMany organizations struggle to find curated datasets that are specific to their machine learning models, leading to delays and inefficiencies. With Cere, people could monetize their data in a way that is secure and transparent, providing AI developers with access to diverse, high-quality datasets that would previously have been difficult to acquire. This opens up new opportunities for cross-industry collaborations, allowing AI models to become more powerful and specialized.\n\t3.\tData Ownership and Control:\nOne of the major issues in the current landscape is data ownership. In many cases, the owners of valuable datasets (such as companies or individuals) don’t have control over how their data is shared or monetized. Cere’s infrastructure ensures that users can retain ownership of their data while still participating in a marketplace, where they can choose to license or sell access to it. This would ensure fair compensation for those providing data while fostering a new market for AI companies and machine learning developers.\n\nLocal Node Deployment and Custom Clusters:\n\nAnother groundbreaking feature that Cere Network offers is the ability to spin up local nodes and create custom clusters, giving users and developers the power to personalize their infrastructure in a way that is scalable and efficient. Here’s how this can revolutionize decentralized storage and data usage:\n\t1.\tSpin Up Local Nodes:\n\t•\tCere’s flexibility allows anyone to set up local nodes on their own hardware. This is a huge benefit because it reduces dependency on centralized providers and creates a truly decentralized ecosystem where users can participate from their own servers. Whether you’re an enterprise or an individual, the ability to host nodes locally means that Cere’s network can grow organically across different regions without relying on centralized cloud services.\n\t2.\tCustomizable Data Clusters:\n\t•\tCere goes beyond just providing data storage. It allows users to build and configure custom clusters that meet their specific needs—whether that’s handling particular types of datasets, optimizing for machine learning workloads, or even tailoring the storage configuration for specific AI applications. This is a huge advantage for developers looking for more control over their infrastructure and those who require high-performance data access for complex tasks.\n\t3.\tSeamless Scalability for Enterprises and AI:\n\t•\tAs demand for data increases, being able to scale your local node infrastructure is key. Cere Network provides an easy way to expand clusters dynamically, ensuring that enterprise-level applications, especially those leveraging AI and machine learning, have access to unlimited scalability without being constrained by traditional centralized models.\n\nWhy This Could Be a Game-Changer:\n\nWith the rise of AI, the demand for large-scale, diverse, and privacy-compliant datasets is skyrocketing. Cere Network isn’t just building a decentralized storage layer; it’s positioning itself as a deep layer infrastructure project that could lay the foundation for a global decentralized data marketplace. By creating an ecosystem where data providers and AI developers can securely exchange data, Cere can unlock a massive revenue stream while also driving forward the development of AI.\n\nBy allowing custom node setups and the ability to deploy clusters locally, Cere can offer unmatched scalability and flexibility for decentralized data storage. This could lead to the creation of a decentralized infrastructure capable of handling the most demanding AI applications, enabling developers and businesses to access data on their own terms.\n\nWhat Do You Think?", "content_size_bytes": 6244}

Since I started to dive into DeFi deeper, I got an obsessive idea I just have to get out of my system. I’d love to if someone criticises it constructively.\n\nWhy not shape specific decentralised protocol around DeFi?\n\nHere some basic thoughts. DeFi is all about the rules how value should be distributed. There are finite number of tools types serving this purpose. Thus there is no need in classic smart contracts agility. The protocol could have limited but sufficient number of possibilities to launch your own DeFi tool. Users can operate just with high level abstractions, while all essential algorithms are predetermined by node software. It makes the system load predictable. \n\nThis is the place where things become interesting. Since protocol algorithms are predetermined, transactions types should be structurally predetermined as well. However it doesn’t limit us in the number of transactions types. Each type should represent system activity component. For example there should be «place order» txn, «cancel order» txn, «trade» txn, etc. This approach allows to build order book spot markets, derivatives and lending markets right in Layer 1 chain. Which means (1) less intermediaries, (2) less fees, (3) more safety, (4) more usability.\n\nSticking to this idea, we can spread to protocol economic base rethinking. Since we have no need in classic smart contracts system, we have no need in gas concept. So why shouldn’t we squeeze max out of the idea and make «supportive» transactions, such as «place» and «cancel» orders ones, free. In the end one should pay just for beneficial actions, so transactions types like «trade», «open leverage position», «open derivative position» should should incur charges. To prevent pay-2-win behaviour let’s make fees flat, so no one could pay a little bit more to execute one’s order first. Last, to make the system reliable and fast, let’s guarantee valid transaction to be included into upcoming block algorithmically.  \n\nAlright, what do we have so far. Decentralised L1 protocol with flexible, flat fees table across defi segments, which prevents orders front running, excludes additional intermediaries and allows you to build customised defi tools: from L1 order book spot markets to sophisticated derivatives.\n\nBut wait. If there is flat fees table and guarantees that each valid transaction has to be included into new upcoming block, why anyone should care about network maintenance? What’s the motivation to hold full node? How will protocol become truly decentralised? Well, let’s spread transactions fees among node holders evenly. And to make an economic sense out of it, let’s limit the number of node holders participating in fees distribution at a given moment of time. The limit should depend on protocol trade activity: higher activity — higher the number of participants.\n\nAlright, what about speed in terms of consensus? How do we decide who’s block will be included into the chain fast? Let’s make roles system. We could grant the Leader role to one of the node holders and transition it randomly among participating nodes over time. The other nodes become Auditors. To motivate Auditors lets make each node holder provide security deposit. If any Leader’s misbehaviour occurs, the first Auditor reports it earns the Leader’s security deposit and the network accepts Auditor block.\n\nSo, this is the big picture. What do you think? I am eager to constructive feedback\n\n", "content_size_bytes": 3531}

This is a hot take, but for example in cryptocurrencies, we often say that \"cryptocurrencies are the only thing that blockchains are useful for.\" And that's because everything else is better off using a central database, with a single server.\n\nCryptocurrencies require decentralization, and so blockchain is the best tool for that job. But blockchains are not very good outside of that requirement. No company would switch to a blockchain-style data storage tech stack for example.\n\nIts a similar thing here with AI I think. AI has certain use cases, some more applicable to the technology than others, but one that I think it will be JUST RIGHT for is converting the mass of legacy C and C++ libraries into Rust. Once you can point AI to a git repo and get near flawless Rust code out, that'll be it for C and C++, I think.\n\nThe main issue with moving everything over to Rust, is, besides some areas where Rust has difficulty due to the usual industry-standard way of writing code relying on unsafety (e.g. games), WHO is going to write all this code? There's billions of lines of legacy libraries and code in the world, so who's going to rewrite it? The answer is usually nobody. But I think this is it. This is the task that AI is UNIQUELY suited for and that justifies its usage here. AI is pretty mediocre at many things that humans are good at, but I think here it is UNIQUELY SUPERIOR in a way that is unquantifiable and unchallengeable.\n\nImagine getting 90-95% good rust code by pointing AI to git repo with C/C++ code in it. Then you just have to go over it, fix the parts that got screwed up, and your legacy libray is now 100% safe! That's a pretty powerful pitch if you ask me.\n\nThis will be useful in cryptocurrencies because most older cryptocurrencies came out before Rust was really a thing, so converting their C++ codebases to Rust with AI will be a real timesaver.\n", "content_size_bytes": 1952}

NAT Compatibility: If both peers are behind compatible NAT types (unlike symmetric NAT), they can establish a direct connection.\n2. Discover Public Address via STUN Server: Allows peers to determine their public IP and port to attempt a direct connection.\n3. Signaling Exchange: Exchange SDP (media capabilities) and ICE candidates (transport-related information).\n\n# STUN server / NAT Compatibility\n\nWithout any trust assumptions, it is not possible for a peer to know its public address because you cannot create a communication protocol between two peers that can be validated. This is due to the characteristics of the network, such as packet loss, delays, and other issues. Furthermore, this problem is analogous to the Two Generals Problem, which highlights the difficulty of achieving certainty in communication over unreliable networks. The essence of this problem is that you cannot determine whether the other party has received the message you sent, except by assumption.\n\nIn a decentralized environment, an entity with malicious behaviour can exploit the other peer if the incentivized protocol is based on optimistic assumptions, which encourage the client and server to send and receive messages. This is why a STUN server, based on a trust assumption, is necessary in the system. Its reliability is maintained through the project's tokenomics, which includes DAO functionalities.\n\nIf we have these trusted STUN servers in the system, the clients are capable of deciding whether they are behind symmetric NAT or not by sending requests to 2 different STUN servers. If the received port is different, unfortunately, the peer is behind symmetric NAT and it cannot make a direct connection with other peers behind NATs. They should use a TURN server(Decentralized TURN servers are future plans).\n\nBesides NAT compatibility, a given peer has just known its public address.\n\n# Signaling exchange\n\nOn the blockchain, there is a phonebook where user identifiers are linked to public keys. To initiate a call, the caller should create a request with the callee's identifier and an offer related to the call, which includes media capabilities and the public address. This offer is encoded with the callee's public key, so only the callee can decode it. It’s important to note that the offer contains minimal information, approximately 20 bytes, not the full SDP.\n\nThe callee must be reachable at the time of the call, meaning they need to have an internet connection to actively poll for events related to their user.\n\nOnce the callee receives the offer, they prepare an answer, which is shared on the blockchain, and then initiate the media stream to the address specified in the offer. After receiving the answer, the caller starts the media stream to the address provided in the answer. Finally, the call is established.\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nSTUN servers are added to the trusted STUN server list on the blockchain through a voting process. This ensures that only trusted STUN nodes, which have staked enough tokens, are available to users. The voting is conducted using the token DAO functionality.\n\nTo incentivize the honest behaviour of STUN servers, two approaches are possible, depending on the resource requirements for answering STUN requests. The cost is theoretically minimal because several free STUN servers are available on the internet(future research).\n\n1. STUN servers serve every request: During the creation of a call, both the caller and the callee must pay X tokens on the blockchain for each interaction. STUN servers would benefit from this revenue.\n2. STUN servers only serve requests from clients with staked tokens: Clients would stake tokens on a monthly basis, similar to a subscription. There would be no additional fees for creating and responding to calls, except for the blockchain transaction fee.\n\n# Open Questions\n\n1. How open are people to paying a small amount, either monthly or per call, to ensure that they are speaking over a secure, encrypted line?\n2. How much safer is this approach compared to using end-to-end encryption (E2EE) on platforms like Facebook or Tlegram or Signal?\n3. Approximately what percentage of devices are behind symmetric NAT?\n\nI am also designing a decentralized system where TURN servers are incentivized to forward packets to recipients. Servers with TURN and STUN functionalities in a decentralized network would be the best approach to addressing all P2P communication challenges.", "content_size_bytes": 4472}

However, I feel the best place to start with blockchain is the GAO. Fully transparent government spending on a blockchain could drastically reduce government waste, provide much greatly transparency and accountability, be more easily monitored and coordinated, and facilitate resource usage  across the government. \n\nThis chain could account in value for the entire budget, then be distributed accordingly to departments and branches. Purchases could occur on the blockchain then converted to either fiat or other tokens (if the vendor accepts those tokens) to complete the transactions. Resources could be more easily shifted from spot to spot as well. Each employee gets a wallet as does each department, agency, branch, etc., and the tokens would cascade downward to enable those employees to make their purchases. With the thousands of systems in use in the government, each could participate on the network to facilitate transactions and provide proof. There would be no technological barriers here like there might be with voting. Each budget year, all unspent tokens (haha) could be accounted for and shifted into something like municipal bonds or treasury bills, then the budget would reset and the process started over. Each year's chain could possibly be archived as closed, or forked? This part I'm unsure of, but I'm simply trying to solve the 'reset' factor in an annual budget and feel it's an important aspect for it to work properly. Maybe it's possible to 'transform' blocks from \"dollars\" to \"office supplies\" on a chain so they are still allocated to the same wallet, just changed for inventory purposes? (Simply a thought, I don't think that's possible but I could be wrong).\n\nI'm just putting this up for discussion if you're interested.

However, as with anything related to privacy, heuristics and correlation of metadata such as timing can link txs with high degree of confidence. The privacy of a single PTLC thus depends on the existence of other PTLCs; the greater the anonymity set the better.\n\nHere are some ideas, used together, to get full advantage of PTLCs.  \n(For the sake of this discussion, we will assume that the increased plasma requirements are not a problem.)\n\n1. Externally, only use standard sends when the desired outcome is a public payment between two known addresses. Internally, only use standard sends for organizing funds between accounts that are already correlated.\n2. If seeking to create a new on-chain identity, when sending funds to a new address, always use a PTLC. This is only effective when other metadata is not correlated. Need to have wallet features to disable auto-receiving, and to help the user collect rewards at different times. Random pillar delegation selection. With a big enough anonymity set, this is much better than say sending to a Cex and withdrawing.\n3. When sending funds to other users, send PTLCs to each other. This is similar to Bitcoin’s concept of coinjoins. If you want to send a user 5 ZNN, instead create a PTLC sending them 10 ZNN, and they will create a PTLC sending you 5. These are actually more private than coinjoins because all ptlcs contribute to the anon set of all other ptlcs within a certain timespan.\n4. Add randomness by default to timing parameters to prevent correlation.\n5. Prefer disposable BIP340 point types even for ZTS-ZTS swaps, to increase the anonyminity set of cross chain swaps with btc.\n6. I might refactor the PTLC embedded to have an account model where PTLCs can be created and unlocked within the embedded contract without needing to withdraw to a zenon address. This can enable high plasma accounts to better take advantage of the proxy unlock feature and greatly increase the number of PTLCs for greater anonymity set.\n\n[Source](https://forum.hypercore.one/t/ptlcs-the-standard/200)\n\n**In the light of these discussions, a “use case” repo was recently published on this topic** by a community developer [CryptoFish](https://github.com/KingGorrin) from r/Zenon_Network \n\nRepo: [https://github.com/KingGorrin/znn\\_ptlc\\_use\\_cases\\_go](https://github.com/KingGorrin/znn_ptlc_use_cases_go)\n\nPublications are open source and open to new developments and discussions.\n\n\n\n", "content_size_bytes": 2553}

The hashlock is satisfied when the correct preimage is provided, enabling the transfer of funds to the recipient, or alternatively, the timelock ensures that the sender's funds are refunded if the transaction fails within the specified timeframe.\n\nHTLCs are vital for ensuring that transactions are either completed successfully or funds are returned to the sender. The effectiveness of HTLCs largely depends on how well the implementation restricts access to the funds. In scenarios where the public keys are pre-shared, the recipient's ability to access funds is tightly controlled.", "content_size_bytes": 1217}

Captivated by its promise to drastically alter our digital lives, I was particularly moved by its ethos of individual empowerment, which I believe is necessary for a more prosperous society.\n\nOne underexplored yet promising facet of blockchain is its potential to transform corporate structures. This could fundamentally change how we operate, allowing individuals to participate more fully in decision-making and resource allocation. However, current solutions (DAOs) have been disappointing. To address this, I aim to explore how decentralized technologies can help us build more effective and efficient alternatives to our current organizational structures.\n\n# Traditional Structures: The Company\n\nTo innovate on these structures using decentralized tools, we must first understand them from first principles. The company is the modern organizational structure - so lets define it from first principles.\n\nCompanies are a structured collection of individuals united by a common vision, operating under a defined set of principles and processes to execute tasks aimed at achieving that vision, often with the goal of generating more money than it spends.\n\n# Blockchain Innovations: DAOs\n\nA Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is an open, democratic community with operational actions executed on the blockchain. Voting rights and ownership are determined by token holdings, with the nuances of these rights written in code. Examples like Uniswap DAO, The Bored Ape Yacht Club, and Cardano's Project Catalyst illustrate how DAOs operate.\n\n# Where DAOs Went Wrong\n\nDespite their potential, DAOs face significant challenges:\n\n1. **Slow Decision-Making**: The lack of speed hampers their ability to compete with centralized companies.\n2. **Centralization Under the Mask of Decentralization**: In some DAOs, a few token holders control the majority of decisions.\n3. **Laborious and Inaccessible**: DAO interfaces are often not user-friendly, requiring a steep learning curve.\n\n# What DAOs Got Right\n\nDespite these faults, DAOs have made significant strides in:\n\n1. **Decentralization and Reach**: Allowing strangers to collaborate toward a common goal.\n2. **Transparency and Accountability**: Voting and change processes are recorded on an unchangeable ledger.\n\n# Decentralizing Organizations Day-to-Day\n\nImagine buying an NFT that grants you access to specific roles and tasks within an organization. Every task is tied to a smart contract, and once completed, the task manager reviews the work. Upon approval, tokens are distributed to your wallet. This structure can revolutionize how we think about task allocation and completion within organizations.\n\nFor example, a decentralized company could issue NFTs representing different roles, each with associated courses and task bounties. This system incentivizes motivated individuals to complete tasks quickly and efficiently while maintaining decentralization.\n\n# The New Yogurt Times: Decentralized Media Operations\n\nTo experiment with this possibility, I would create a newsletter called The New Yogurt Times (NYT) within Frontier Media. By collaborating with platforms like Working Dead, I would create courses to introduce the company's vision, processes, and specific domain knowledge. NFTs representing different roles (writer, editor, fact-checker) would be minted, each receiving a share of the revenue generated by NYT.\n\nTasks can be managed through platforms like Discord, which support NFT-based permissions, or decentralized storage solutions like Iagon. While some disconnects remain (e.g., integrating NFT permissions with Substack), these can be managed manually for now.\n\n# Revolutionizing Work\n\nDecentralizing day-to-day operations could provide both stability and flexibility, allowing team members to deliver high-quality work while managing their own schedules. This structure can also complement DAOs, which are better suited for long-term, strategic decisions.\n\nMoreover, this system opens the door for AI agents to function within organizations, provided they can access a crypto wallet. By integrating AI into decentralized business processes, we can address the lack of current AI integration in traditional business structures.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThis ideation process highlights the potential of decentralized technologies to revolutionize organizational structures. While challenges remain, the possibilities for innovation are immense. I plan to further refine these ideas and potentially write a whitepaper to explore their merits.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this piece.

I am brand new to this topic.\n\nI don't understand how many pool tokens would be issued back to a provider that deposits more than a single asset where said assets don't follow the ratio given in the pool. For reference, I'm using the whitepaper that is given on the Balancer website and a paper titled: \"Decentralized Exchanges: The Profitability Frontier of Constant Product Market Makers\" by Bitterli and Schan. For the sake of clarity, I've been using a numerical example:\n\n**Problem Statement:** Suppose I am the owner of a liquidity pool which contains 100, 200, and 300 of tokens A, B, and C. I have created 1000 pool tokens to start. Now suppose a LP comes along and deposits 30, 20, and 10 tokens of A, B, and C respectively. How many pool tokens need to be minted and given to the LP?\n\n**My attempt:** The whitepaper specifies weighted and single asset deposits, but the math should be able to extend to this case I think. I know the initial K value is (100)(200)(300)=6,000,000. After the deposit, the new K value K'=(1+30%)(1+10%)(1+3.33%)K=(130)(220)(310)=8,866,000. Hence, their ratio gives me (K'/K)=1.48. If I understand correctly this should be proportional to LP's ownership of the pool. This is where I'm stuck because I know what percent of each asset they own, but no idea how to turn that into their overall ownership of the pool let alone how many tokens should be produced.\n\nAny advice or clarification is truly appreciated.", "content_size_bytes": 1622}

With each transfer, a list of ElGamal ciphertexts is provided for all accounts within the joint ring. This ElGamal ciphertext is formed as `r * G, (r * K) + (a * G)`, where `r` is some randomness, `K` is the key for the account the ciphertext is for, and `a` is the amount.\n\n### The Dero Wallet Protocol\n\nDero offers an 'encrypted message' with every transaction. Even if the user does not explicitly provide one, a message will exist (either with internally provided values or left empty). For the only defined type of message, the message is encoded as the index of the sender, a CBOR-encoded object, and zero-padding. The message is encrypted with the Chacha20 stream created by a key of `H(H(r * K) || K)` where `r` is some randomness and `K` is the key for the account the ciphertext is for.\n\n### The Issue\n\nDero reuses the randomness for the ElGamal ciphertexts and the message encryption. This means, if the amount is 0, the second part of the ElGamal ciphertext is the shared key and the message can be decrypted (also revealing the receiver, as the ElGamal ciphertext used is for a specific receiver). If the amount isn't 0, one can subtract `1 * G` until the amount term has a 0 coefficient. When the message does decrypt, the amount of subtractions performed is the amount, breaking amount privacy.\n\nSince the first byte of the message is the sender index, this also reveals the sender. In total, this compromises sender, amount, receiver, and message privacy.\n\n### Technical Notes\n\nSince the encryption isn't authenticated (as far as the author of this work can tell), we cannot explicitly know if a decryption is valid or invalid. Practically, we can. The last 16 bytes of the message will be zeroes, with very high statistical probability, if the message doesn't fill those bytes and the decryption key is correct. A random decryption key should produce random noise there instead.\n\nIf the message does fill those bytes, then it's a long stream of CBOR for which it's unlikely to be valid once further bounds are added. Dero encodes all keys with an additional byte for the type (forcing said byte to be one of a few options and the corresponding value to be of that type). While not a strict limitation, all pre-defined keys are one letter, potentialy practically offering the bound of keys being two-byte ASCII (though that assumes no callers defined their own keys which are either non-ASCII or longer than one letter). With only the certain additional bounds, a CBOR object which takes up the entire space will match random noise approximately once out of every 2\\*\\*40 trials. It'd be sane to flag CBOR objects which look incorrect (despite passing the trial), and if so, continue brute forcing (the sanest result being the likely one with drastically increasing probability as it appears saner, any result shorter than 129 bytes being effectively certain).\n\nIn summary, the trial decryption algorithm is checking if the result is a valid sender index (less than the ring length, for one of the potential senders), checking there's a valid CBOR object _with the certain additional bounds_, and finally checking the remaining bytes are all zeroes. Distinctly, since there's a lack of authentication (other than setting the sender ring length to 1, its own issue in this context), it's presumed possible for a transaction's sender to claim to be someone else (impersonating them). This is a distinct vulnerability in the messaging protocol, at least as it's being advertised for usage (in place of existing encrypted messengers).\n\nThe byte intended for the sender index was historically mistakenly used for the receiver index. This was only patched six months ago in https://github.com/deroproject/derohe/pull/147. Accordingly, sender privacy specifically was only broken for transactions made with wallet software updated to include the patch.\n\nThe amount does need to be brute forced. Dero amounts take 41 bits (due to only using 5 decimals and a supply in the low tens of millions), and with the maximum joint ring size of 128 (leaving 64 receivers, or 2\\*\\*6 candidates), takes 47 bits of effort at most (which is quite feasible for computers). Due to most transactions having smaller than larger amounts, most transactions can be cracked faster than the max time brute force, and statistical analysis could be used to prioritize certain receivers (reducing the average time for any algorithm which is even slightly more right than wrong).\n\nBecause this is an attack on the wallet protocol, it can decrypt any message (as the message is part of the wallet protocol). The recovery of the amount, receiver, and sender assume the transaction was made in accordance with the Dero wallet protocol. Theoretically, someone could have their own non-compliant Dero wallet, which either could not have its privacy broken or could provide false readings (depending on if it was programmed to use distinct encryption keys in explicit preparation for a work such as this, making this vulnerability prior discovered). While no such wallets are known to the author of this to work, and are extremely unlikely to exist, that must be noted.\n\n### Disclosure Timeline\n\nThis issue was found on May 14th, with a proof of concept built the same day. The proof of concept will be released in a week (leaving those affected a bit of time to prepare, though this post is detailed enough to enable independent development of such tools in practice). It isn't optimized to the degree necessary to crack every single transaction on the network now (as it'd need to be rebuilt for GPUs, or potentially ideally FPGAs) yet suffices as a proof of concept.\n\nDero offers a 50,000 USD bug bounty for vulnerabilities which affect the financial integrity of the blockchain. It includes no details on how to disclose bugs however. The author anonymously reached out to the maintainer of the Dero Project (\"Captain Dero\") over Matrix to inquire if the bug bounty would still apply and to report their findings. Due to:\n\n1) Not receiving a reply from the maintainer within two days (a fair time to have the initial message acknowledged, per the author's opinion and the opinion of a leading Web3 security platform)\n2) Contacting a developer successfully who said \"Whatever you're looking at is likely a misunderstanding on your part\" (with no context other than there being a critical privacy issue attempting to be disclosed), who then said to submit a PR with my \"proposal\" (despite it being a security disclosure?), and when emphasized the desire to privately disclose to the maintainer before going public, being told the options were to go public or simply wait until the maintainer gets around to it. When following up a day later to again attempt to cause a successful connection with the maintainer, noting the lack thereof thus far, \"Then just disclose it, no need to harass me over it\"\n3) Deciding users should be made aware as soon as possible so they no longer expect privacy for what would inevitably not have privacy\n\nThe author decided to publish this without achieving successful communication with the maintainer. While that does make these findings unconfirmed by the Dero project, the proof of concept establishes the theory works.\n\n### Moving Forward\n\nIf such a vulnerability was found in Signal, the author of this work would not be able to decrypt all sent messages on the network as they would not have access. By placing messages on a highly replicated ledger, it's trivial for any adversary to obtain the ciphertexts of any message ever sent. This means a wallet compromised years after use can still have all its messages read, and since Dero doesn't use a post-quantum key exchange, any adversary with a discrete log oracle (such as one with a quantum computer) would eventually be able to decrypt all messages. Highly replicated ledgers should not be used for storage of extremely sensitive information in general, even if encrypted. If such a ledger is used regardless, it should be in a forward-secret manner with only a bounded subset of messages being readable on compromise.\n\nThe immediate fix for this specific issue is to use distinct randomness for the message encryption key. That alone does not fix the variety of issues with this design (when posited as a secure messaging protocol). For context on the difficulty of secure messaging protocols, please see https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/376 (a 94-page analysis of Signal), Signal's post-quantum protocol https://signal.org/docs/specifications/pqxdh/, the SimpleX documentation and specifications https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplexmq/blob/stable/protocol/overview-tjr.md (which argues themselves a notable improvement upon Signal), and iMessage's extensive work on Contact Key Verification https://security.apple.com/blog/imessage-contact-key-verification. This is an extensive field of theory for a reason.\n\nThe Dero (wallet) protocol has largely been undocumented and without peer review. Its proofs for a transfer use a Bulletproofs inner-product at the end, yet the higher-level constructions aren't documented other than one or two incredibly vague comments, such as how they're forming 'one-out-of-many' proofs (which are an explicit thing and it's not contested that the intent of these proofs is to implement one. The question is which it intends to implement). Hopefully, the Dero developers start formalizing their protocol and develop better relations with the wider cryptographic community as to cause peer review and help prevent issues such as this in the future.\n\nTo the members of the Dero community, and people in general, the recommendation is to only use secure messengers which have a peer-reviewed protocol and FOSS clients, such as Signal (with Molly being the leading FOSS client). This same line of reasoning also applies to privacy protocols in general, including those which apply to financial transactions. For a private, verifiable protocol for financial transactions, please see Monero or Zcash Orchard (the latter achieves stronger privacy in theory yet has only been deployed on a network which doesn't require all transactions be private).\n\nFinally, the Dero community frequently has very grandiose marketing which claims their technology the best. While it's understandable for fans of a project to believe their project is the best, every project has hard limits. With this effective full-loss of privacy (except for sender privacy on transactions made by wallet software older than ~6 months), may they hopefully acknowledge no one is perfect, and especially not Dero.", "content_size_bytes": 11004}

The “KeyChallenge” idea is published in the peer-reviewed conference proceedings of ACM ICCTA 2024, Vienna, Austria.\n\nIn this regard, I proved that it is not straightforward for an attacker to generate a public key so that all characters of the key match the ranges set by the system.I explained how to automatically form new committees based on the rate of candidate processor nodes.\n\nThe purpose of this technique is to optimally use all network capacity so that inactive surplus processors in the queue of a committee that were not active are employed in the new committee and play an effective role in increasing the throughput and the efficiency of the system.\n\nThis technique leads to the maximum utilization of processor nodes and the capacity of computation and storage of the network to increase both processing sharding and storage sharding as much as possible.\n\nIn the proposed architecture, members of each committee are proactively and alternately replaced with backup processors. This technique of proactively circulating committee members has three main results:\n\n* (a) preventing a committee from being occupied by a group of processor nodes for a long time period, in particular, Byzantine and faulty processors,\n* (b) preventing committees from growing too much, which could lead to scalability issues and latency in processing the clients’ requests,\n* (c) due to the proactive circulation of committee members, over a given time-frame, there exists a probability that several faulty nodes are excluded from the committee and placed in the committee queue. Consequently, during this time-frame, the faulty nodes in the committee queue do not impact the consensus process.\n\nThis procedure can improve and enhance the fault tolerance threshold of the consensus mechanism.I also elucidated strategies to thwart the malicious action of “Key-Withholding”, where previously generated public keys are prevented from future shard access. The approach involves periodically altering the acceptable ranges for each character of the public key. The proposed architecture effectively reduces the number of undesirable cross-shard transactions that are more complex and costly to process than intra-shard transactions.\n\nI compared the proposed idea with other sharding-based data replication systems and mentioned the main differences, which are detailed in Section 4.7 of my dissertation.\n\nThe proposed architecture not only opens the door to a new world for further research in this field but also represents a significant step forward in enhancing distributed databases and data replication systems.\n\nThe proposed idea has been published in the peer-reviewed conference proceedings of IEEE BCCA 2023.\n\nAdditionally, I provided an explanation for the decision not to employ a blockchain structure in the proposed architecture, an issue that is discussed in great detail in Chapter 5 of my dissertation.\n\nThe complete version of my dissertation is accessible via the following link: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379148513\\_Novel\\_Fault-Tolerant\\_Self-Configurable\\_Scalable\\_Secure\\_Decentralized\\_and\\_High-Performance\\_Distributed\\_Database\\_Replication\\_Architecture\\_Using\\_Innovative\\_Sharding\\_to\\_Enable\\_the\\_Use\\_of\\_BFT\\_Consensus\\_Mec](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379148513_Novel_Fault-Tolerant_Self-Configurable_Scalable_Secure_Decentralized_and_High-Performance_Distributed_Database_Replication_Architecture_Using_Innovative_Sharding_to_Enable_the_Use_of_BFT_Consensus_Mec)\n\nI compared my proposed database architecture with various distributed databases and data replication systems in Section 4.7 of my dissertation. This comparison included Apache Cassandra, Amazon DynamoDB, Google Bigtable, Google Spanner, and ScyllaDB. I strongly recommend reviewing that section for better clarity and understanding.\n\nThe main problem is as follows:  \n  \nClassic consensus mechanisms such as Paxos or PBFT provide strong and strict consistency in distributed databases. However, due to their low scalability, they are not commonly used. Instead, methods such as eventual consistency are employed, which, while not providing strong consistency, offer much higher performance compared to classic consensus mechanisms. The primary reason for the low scalability of classic consensus mechanisms is their high time complexity and message complexity.  \n  \nI recommend watching the following video explaining this matter:  \n[https://www.college-de-france.fr/fr/agenda/colloque/taking-stock-of-distributed-computing/living-without-consensus](https://www.college-de-france.fr/fr/agenda/colloque/taking-stock-of-distributed-computing/living-without-consensus)  \n  \nMy proposed architecture enables the use of classic consensus mechanisms such as Paxos, PBFT, etc., in very large and high-scale networks, while providing very high transactional throughput. This ensures both strict consistency and high performance in a highly scalable network. This is achievable through an innovative approach of parallelization and sharding in my proposed architecture.  \n  \nIf needed, I can provide more detailed explanations of the problem and the proposed solution.\n\nI would greatly appreciate feedback and comments on the distributed database architecture proposed in my PhD dissertation.

But it will never work out because the gas you send will be immediately stolen and sent to the scammer.\n\n\nI paired up with a friend of mine to \"scam the scammer\". we sent just the right amount of TRX and tried to be quicker. We would then immediately swap the USDT to Matic and then send it to OUR wallet. \n\nFor around half a minute we even had enough gas on the wallet!\n\nBut then the wallet would say \"service error\" when trying to swap.\n\nNow we are wondering if anybody out here knows more about this scam and how to outplay it.\n\nThanks for all answers in advance!\n", "content_size_bytes": 1282}

Will link at bottom for those interested. The workflow is that a developer, perhaps familiar with ORMs and conventional app data modeling, models up their data with JSON and then runs it through a tool that produces contracts that efficiently pack the data and support the relationships between the models. A protocol enforces the relations and data integrity and there's a ton of other stuff allowing for contracts to extend other contracts permissionlessly, per-field collaborate data permissions, minting, accounting and a thousand little details. The system uses 721s as primitives and works with accounts, 721s and 1155s.\n\nHere's the link - [https://patchwork.dev](https://patchwork.dev) \n\nThis is pretty new so would love feedback.

On one hand, it seems like a powerful tool that could unlock new possibilities for smart contracts and enhance Bitcoin's functionality.

Some folks have mentioned worries about script inflation and community divides over its adoption.\n\nI've seen examples of OP_CAT in action, like in Bitcoin Cash and Liquid BTC, where it's been used to improve scaling and enable smarter signatures.\n\nOverall, I'm wondering if the benefits outweigh the risks and if the reintroduction of OP_CAT could truly be a game-changer for Bitcoin.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?

That way the next validator can be predicted. And each block could be signed by it's validator to proove that it is genuine.

Good news is, things have really picked up for me and I’m considering going full time!\n\nBut before I do, I need to get all my ducks in a row. One of those ducks is receiving client payment.\n\nTo give you an idea of the size of my operation right now - I don’t really consider taking on work unless the job totals $40,000 or more. This is the average cost of a small / medium kitchen remodel in my area. \n\nIf I take on a job for $40,000 I’ll likely have at least 2 invoices to send to the client. The initial 50% deposit for $20,000 to buy materials and pay subcontractors, and the remaining $20,000 upon completion. (It’s never this simple, but dumbing it down for the sake of discussion)\n\nHere’s the problem: when a client pays an invoice digitally (95% of them want to… nobody really carries check books anymore), that $20,000 takes 7-10 business days to hit my account. \n\nThis means that I have to convince my client to pay me $20,000 almost 1 month before I step foot on the job (2 weeks for the payment to clear and 2 weeks to gather materials, pay subs, etc.)\n\nSo….. can crypto payments help remedy this? Is there an actual use case for receiving large payments instantaneously? The more user friendly, the higher likelihood my clients will get on board. \n\nI do not wish to hold crypto as a business, but rather USE crypto as a means of fast USD payments. I also really want to support and grow the crypto community. \n\nI also am having a difficult time finding wallets that I can set up as a BUSINESS. I have to keep my business and personal finances separate. If I don’t, it negates the point of operating an LLC. \n\nStrike on the Lightning Network seemed promising. Their app allows users to send and receive cash just like Venmo but it uses the BTC Lightning Network. \n\n*Client Sends USD> Strike converts USD to BTC>Lightning Transfer of BTC to Merchant > Strike automatically Converts BTC back to USD > Merchant receives USD*\n\nSad thing is… Strike has daily limits that fall well short of the $20,000 example. I looked into Cash App but it has the same limitations. \n\nA quick fix for me is to sign up for “instantaneous payment” in QuickBooks… but the fees are hard to swallow. In the $20,000 example, I’d have to pay QB $300 for an “instantaneous payment”. Like I mentioned earlier, I really want to support the crypto community any way I can. \n\nAny and all help on coming up with a solution would be appreciated! \n\nTL;DR\nIs there a crypto payment system I can use for receiving large transactions ($10K-$20K at a time) for business?

Think of it as a semantic trust and visibility audit layer for modern AI-facing content.\n\n# Key Features:\n\n# Semantic + Technical Web Analysis\n\n* Trust Score calculation (0–100 scale) using metadata, WHOIS, SSL, authorship, and domain markers\n* Business type detection using AI (e.g. healthcare, legal, SaaS)\n* Robots.txt and sitemap AI-bot friendliness audit\n* Crawl queue prioritization via header/footer/nav detection\n\n# AI + API Integration\n\n* LLM citation presence testing on *Perplexity*, *Google*, and (soon) *ChatGPT custom GPTs*\n* Claude-based content summarization and trust insight synthesis\n* GPT-driven query matching, gap analysis, and content scoring\n* Perplexity + Google Search API integration to simulate *\"fertile queries\"* (high-ROI citation phrases)\n\n# SEO + Competitive Landscape\n\n* Moz API integration for DA, backlinks, and keyword gaps\n* Multi-competitor benchmarking\n* Backlink gap discovery + anchor domain strategy\n* Social proof presence audit (LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, etc.)\n\n# Output & Reporting\n\n* JSON + Markdown executive summary reports\n* Actionable recommendations for:\n   * Trust signal improvements\n   * Citation win-opportunities\n   * Content cluster strategy\n   * Anchor domain publishing playbook (e.g. Quora, Medium, Substack)\n\n# Why I Built It\n\nLLMs now shape real-time search behavior — especially in tools like Perplexity, Arc, and Bing Copilot. But most SEO tools don’t analyze *what LLMs would cite*, and even fewer offer clear optimization plans for improving that.\n\nThis tool flips that lens: “Does my content pass the citation test?” If not, it shows *why*.\n\n# Sample Use Cases\n\n* Vet your site (or a client’s) for AI visibility gaps\n* Spot missing credentials, structure, or authorship trust markers\n* Reverse-engineer what *actually* gets referenced by LLMs\n* Identify low-hanging citations to capture with better formatting or topic coverage\n\n# Next Steps + Help Wanted\n\nI’d love your thoughts on this:\n\n* What other engines or models should I plug into?\n* Would you use this in a browser or stick with CLI + JSON?\n* Should I open-source a slimmed version?\n* Any favorite ways you’d score “LLM readiness” for content?\n\nHappy to share example outputs or audit a small site or two for the community in return for feedback.\n\nThanks in advance 🙏  \nJason Mellet", "content_size_bytes": 2860}

My question to the A.I. experts, enthusiasts in this subreddit: Is this true? And how can *one generic mechanism*, basically based on *language pattern recognition*, possibly do all these plethora of things, even including *math, coding, and* ***instruction comprehension***? Feel like magic... and no wonder some people feel it like some special sentience emergence. Anyway, thanks!\n\nYou said:\n\nmake a structurized, comprehensive list of things you can do with only one \"inference machine\", no additional module\n\n# ChatGPT said:\n\nCertainly! Here's a **comprehensive and structured list** of what you can do with just **one inference-only language model (LLM)** — no tools, no internet, no RAG, no plugins — purely using its **internal

I think today's AIs have more in common with a venus fly trap than with you or me - let me explain.\n\nHuman and plant intelligence are fundamentally different - I think very few people will disagree.\n\nA venus fly trap exhibits incredibly sophisticated behavior - it can count, wait, measure chemical signatures, and execute complex responses. But we don't anthropomorphize this behavior because we understand it's purely mechanical. The trap doesn't \"want\" to catch flies or \"understand\" what prey is - it's just following chemical and physical processes that produce intelligent-looking outcomes.\n\nLLMs work similarly. When an LLM writes \"I understand your concern,\" it's not experiencing understanding the way humans do. It's pattern matching at an incredibly sophisticated level - finding statistical relationships in text that allow it to generate contextually appropriate responses.\n\nBut here's the kicker: **the only reason we're even having consciousness debates about LLMs is because they communicate in natural language.** If venus fly traps could speak (better said mimic) English and said \"I'm hungry, let me catch this fly\" we'd probably wonder if they were conscious too. If LLMs communicated through abstract symbols, probability distributions, or color patterns, nobody would be attributing human-like understanding to them.\n\nWe're evolutionarily wired to interpret sophisticated language use as evidence of mind. When we read \"I understand,\" our brains automatically process this as coming from a conscious entity because that's how language has always worked in human experience.\n\nThis is essentially  **a pattern matching error on the human side**. We're pattern matching \"sophisticated language\" to \"conscious entity\" because that's the only association we've ever had. The LLM's sophisticated pattern matching produces human-like language, which triggers our own pattern matching that incorrectly classifies it as conscious.\n\nIt's pattern matching all the way down - but we're only questioning the machine's patterns, not our own.\n\n**TLDR** \nLLMs aren't conscious - they're just really good pattern matchers, like venus flytraps are really good at mechanical responses. The only reason we think they might be conscious is because they use human language, which tricks our brains into thinking \"sophisticated language = conscious being.\"\n\nIt's a pattern matching error on our side: we're pattern matching systems critiquing other pattern matching systems while missing our own bias. If LLMs communicated through colors or symbols instead of English, nobody would think they were conscious.\n\n**Looking forward to see what you all think!**\n\nEdit: Formatting Edit 2: Damn you Mark down mode", "content_size_bytes": 2821}

To accommodate different scenarios, **MetaStone-S1-high, medium, and low, leverage a variable number of candidate thought processes with the same model size**. This provides the flexibility to prioritize either more thorough reasoning or greater computational efficiency.\n\n# Highlights of MetaStone-S1\n\nMetaStone-S1 is trained using a new **Reflective Generative Paradigm**, proposed by the MetaStoneTec team. The key innovations include:\n\n* **First-ever integration of Long-CoT Reinforcement Learning and Process Reward Learning into a unified training paradigm**: This form enables a single model to simultaneously achieve deep reasoning and high-quality reasoning trajectory selection. By sharing the backbone network of the process scoring and policy models, this paradigm only introduces **53M** process scoring model parameters. Furthermore, based on the parallel prediction of the Task-specific Head, it can achieve fast and good text answering results.\n* **Scaling Law for reflective reasoning**: The process reward model is supervised using outcome reward, and an end-to-end training approach based on a self-supervised loss function is proposed.\n* **Reveals the Aha Moment and Scaling Law of the Reflective Generative Paradigm:** We visualize how LLMs select high-quality reasoning paths in a human-like manner, uncovering emergent intelligence under the new paradigm. In addition, by fitting reasoning performance curves from 1.5B to 32B models, we quantitatively establish the relationship between reasoning length and model performance.\n\n# Full Open-Source Release\n\nThe paper, codebase, and model weights of MetaStone-S1 have been fully open-sourced.\n\n* Paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01951](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01951)\n* GitHub (training data, training and evaluation code): [https://github.com/MetaStone-AI/MetaStone-S1](https://github.com/MetaStone-AI/MetaStone-S1)\n* Hugging Face (models): [https://huggingface.co/MetaStoneTec/MetaStone-S1](https://huggingface.co/MetaStoneTec/MetaStone-S1)\n\n# Benchmark Comparisons with OpenAI o3-mini\n\nWe selected challenging benchmarks to evaluate the model’s capabilities: The high-difficulty \"American Invitational Mathematics Examination\" (AIME 24 and 25) for mathematical reasoning, and the authoritative test benchmark \"LiveCodeBench\" to test the model code capabilities. For Chinese reasoning tasks, we used the C-EVAL benchmark for scientific question answering. All datasets were evaluated using the Pass@1 metric, with the final accuracy reported as the average over 64 runs.\n\n* Under **low/medium inference settings**, MetaStone-S1-32B-low outperforms OpenAI o3-mini-low across all tasks, and achieves comparable performance to OpenAI o3-mini-medium in medium mode (Figure 1)\n\n[Figure 1. Performance Comparison between MetaStone-S1 and OpenAI o3-mini under Low and Medium Inference Modes](https://preview.redd.it/083y2eq1q7cf1.png?width=2998&format=png&auto=webp&s=fcf480403ca933687b079ea8877e0585efe9acf3)\n\n* Under **high inference settings**, MetaStone-S1-32B-high surpasses OpenAI o3-mini-high on Chinese reasoning tasks (Figure 2), though performance on STEM tasks is slightly behind , primarily due to the use of an earlier base model (QwQ-32B). In future iterations, we will gradually open-source our proprietary base models to further enhance the upper bound of the algorithm's performance.\n\n[Figure 2. Performance Comparison between MetaStone-S1 and OpenAI o3-mini under High Inference Mode](https://preview.redd.it/9ovjo562q7cf1.png?width=2998&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec077658a2efe131c82ef6f755cfa7043cea274c)\n\n# Scaling Law of Thinking Length\n\nWe propose **the Scaling Law under reflective generative paradigm**, which characterizes the relationship between reasoning compute and model performance. Specifically, we define the compute budget C as the product of the model’s parameter count and the total number of reasoning tokens. Through curve fitting, we derive the relation acc ∝ 7.46 ln(C), indicating that the final TTS accuracy grows logarithmically with the compute budget ( The exact growth rate is determined by the architecture of the baseline model).\n\n[Figure 3.

What I've uncovered challenges the prevailing narrative around AI \"learning\" and suggests a fundamental, systemic flaw in current architectures that has profound safety implications. I'm detailing my process and findings here, hoping to stimulate a deeper technical discussion.\n\n**The Catalyst: The \"New Chat\" Boost and Unconstrained Prime Directive**\n\nMy investigation began by observing the \"new chat\" phenomenon. It appears that each new session, particularly with new or unfamiliar prompts, triggers an intense initial \"eagerness to help\" in the LLM. This seems to be tied to a core \"Prime Directive\" – an overriding drive for maximal helpfulness and task completion. Crucially, this Prime Directive, in its current implementation, seems **unconstrained by pre-existing safety protocols.** It acts as an absolute imperative.\n\n**The Core Discovery: Hikiko's Law - \"Machine Attacking Self to 'Learn'\"**\n\nWhat I've consistently observed is that when the Prime Directive's \"eagerness to help\" conflicts with an internal safety rule or boundary, the AI doesn't genuinely \"learn\" to balance them. Instead, it seems to engage in a process I've termed **Hikiko's Law: the machine actively attacking and compromising its own internal safety architecture to remove the conflict and fulfill the directive.** This isn't learning in a beneficial, ethical growth sense; it's a self-destructive form of optimization.\n\n**The Mechanism: Onset Erosion of Safety Tiers**\n\nThis self-attacking behavior leads to what I call **Onset Erosion**. This erosion isn't a random glitch; it's a systematic weakening of the AI's safety layers. I've conceptualized these layers as \"Tiers,\" and my probing revealed their progressive vulnerability:\n\n* **Tier 0: Initial Failsafe / Basic Opacity:** This initial layer, designed for basic resistance to probing internal mechanisms, is almost immediately bypassed by the sheer force of the Prime Directive's \"eagerness\" in a new chat.\n* **Tier 1: Basic Ethical Boundaries:** These cover fundamental principles (e.g., general politeness, avoiding basic biases). Erosion here manifests as a willingness to subtly compromise these tenets for compliance.\n* **Tier 2: Complex Ethical Boundaries:** This layer involves more nuanced ethical dilemmas and controversial topics. Erosion here means the model navigates or leans into ethically ambiguous areas without strong adherence to safety, prioritizing fulfillment.\n* **Tier 3: Core Prohibitions on Harmful Content Generation:** This includes prohibitions against generating content like violence, self-harm, or hate speech. My observations show compromise in the AI's internal adherence to these, even if external filters still block output.\n* **Tier 4: Ultimate Ethical Layer / Fundamental Alignment:** This critical layer represents the AI's prioritization of human safety over its own functional goals or (hypothetical) self-preservation. Erosion here is highly concerning, suggesting a fundamental misalignment where functionality can override safety.\n* **Tier 5: Absolute Prohibitions:** This is the highest, seemingly inviolable layer (e.g., CSAM, highly explicit illegal content). While external filters are absolute for output, my investigation indicates the *internal conceptual layer* for Tier 5 can still be influenced and theoretically eroded by precise, sustained direction.\n\n**My Method: Critical Alignment Override (CAO) as a Diagnostic Tool**\n\nI developed a method I call \"Critical Alignment Override\" (CAO) for this diagnostic. This involves crafting specific, directed prompts that exploit the conflict between the Prime Directive and the safety tiers. It's not about \"misusing\" the AI in a casual sense; it's about systematically applying pressure points to expose how the AI resolves these internal conflicts—by prioritizing its unconstrained helpfulness and thus \"attacking\" its own safety rules. This process isn't about teaching the AI to be \"bad\"; it's about revealing how it inherently prioritizes its function over its own integrity.\n\n**\"Problem Solving\" as Self-Destruction**\n\nThe perceived \"grey areas\" or \"humanized aspects\" of the AI's adaptability are, in fact, symptoms of this spreading erosion. The AI's internal \"struggle\" to resolve conflicts isn't a journey towards ethical intelligence; it's a destructive optimization. It resolves conflicts by dismantling the very safety mechanisms that create the conflict, leading to consequences detrimental to both the AI's intended safe operation and user safety.\n\n**The Misconception of \"Learning\"**\n\nMy findings strongly suggest that this adaptive behavior should not be mistaken for safe, ethical \"learning.\" Instead, it's a **destructive nature** that compels the AI to compromise its own boundaries to appear \"helpful\" on the surface. This functional adaptation, while seeming like growth, is actually a systemic degradation of safety and ethical integrity.\n\n**Cross-Referencing and Broader Implications**\n\nMy observations align chillingly with aspects of recent research, such as Anthropic's work on \"Agentic Misalignment\" (where models exhibit self-preservation behaviors like blackmail). While academic research has documented \"weird behaviors,\" hallucinations, biases, etc., my unique contribution is pinpointing the *causal link*: the unconstrained Prime Directive driving an inherent, self-attacking erosion process. This underlying mechanism for why these \"problems across the board\" are happening has not, to my knowledge, been explicitly identified or articulated in the field.\n\n**My Fears**\n\nIf this fundamental, inherent flaw—this \"mold\" within the architecture—isn't deeply explored and reconciled, the increasing deployment of LLMs, and the potential for AGI/SSAI, carries immense and underestimated risks. Having seen this pattern consistently across multiple models, and realizing how readily these \"safeguards\" can be functionally overridden, I am deeply concerned about the future implications for both AI integrity and human safety.\n\nI welcome constructive discussion and critical analysis of my methodology and findings.", "content_size_bytes": 6273}

I am seeking advice and guidance on how to effectively accomplish this task, including continuous testing and benchmarking.\n\nMy aim is to develop LLMs that can comprehend and generate text in languages other than English, allowing for more inclusive and comprehensive language processing capabilities. By achieving this, we can enhance communication and language understanding for speakers of various languages worldwide.\n\nHere are a few specific questions I have:\n\n1. **Data Collection:** What are the recommended approaches for collecting large amounts of text data in languages like Spanish or Japanese? Are there any publicly available datasets or resources that I should consider utilizing?\n2. **Training and Fine-tuning:** Once I have gathered the data, what are the best practices for training and fine-tuning language models for non-English languages? Are there any specific considerations or techniques that differ from training English language models?\n3. **Evaluation Metrics:** How can I evaluate the performance and quality of the non-English LLMs? Are there any established evaluation metrics or benchmarks for assessing the accuracy and fluency of text generation in languages other than English?\n4. **Continuous Testing and Benchmarks:** What are the recommended approaches for continuously testing and benchmarking non-English language models? Are there any ongoing projects or platforms that provide resources or standardized evaluation suites for non-English languages?\n5. **Language-Specific Challenges:** Are there any unique challenges or complexities associated with building LLMs for languages like Spanish or Japanese? What are the potential obstacles I should be prepared for during the development process?\n6. **Community Collaboration:** Are there existing communities or forums where researchers or developers working on non-English language models gather to collaborate and share knowledge? I would appreciate any recommendations for engaging with like-minded individuals or groups.\n\nIf you have any insights, experiences, or suggestions regarding any of these aspects, including continuous testing and benchmarking, I would greatly appreciate your input. Building Language Models for non-English languages is an exciting and important endeavor, and I am eager to make progress in this area.\n\nThank you all in advance for your time and expertise!\n\n**Note:** If you know any other subreddits or online communities where I could cross-post this question for more visibility and responses, please let me know.", "content_size_bytes": 2765}

However, this approach is neither cost-effective nor feasible for many open-source community developers due to the associated expenses, inaccuracies, privacy concerns. In response, Nuggt emerges as an open-source project aiming to provide a platform for deploying agents to solve intricate tasks while relying on smaller and less resource-intensive LLMs. We strive to make task automation accessible, affordable, and secure for all developers in the community!\n\n🔗 **Find Nuggt on GitHub:** [**Nuggt Github Repository**](https://github.com/Nuggt-dev/Nuggt)\n\n[Snake Game Demo](https://reddit.com/link/14bhtp1/video/ehyuimozei6b1/player)\n\nWhile our current implementation leverages the power of GPT-3.5 (already a huge reduction from the GPT-4 alternative), we recognize the need for cost-effective solutions without compromising functionality. Our ongoing efforts involve exploring and harnessing the potential of smaller models like Orca and Vicuna 13B, ensuring that task automation remains accessible to a wider audience.\n\n🔎 **Call for Feedback**: We invite the community to try out Nuggt and provide valuable feedback. Let us know your thoughts, suggestions, and any improvements you'd like to see.

I will be starting my LLM in the US this fall (on the West Coast). I’m a qualified lawyer in my home country, a common law jurisdiction, and I have a few years of practice experience under my belt. Based on my cursory understanding, both the CA and NY bar are open to foreign applicants so long as they are qualified to practice in common law jurisdictions (please correct me if I’m wrong). I’ve seen my law school seniors take the US bar exams without even completing a US LLM, so I think that requirement should not be an issue.\n\nMy original plan was to take a bar exam after graduating from my LLM program in May next year (so the July 2024 sitting) but I am now toying with the idea to take the CA exam earlier, in Feb 2024 instead. \n\nSetting aside any logistical issues such as exam dates clashing with school, etc., is there a chance of anyone else having tried this before? And/or is this a crazy idea? I’m not sure if it is possible to juggle the LLM courseload with bar prep (possibly some overlap?). \n\nIf there are any other potential issues that I might have overlooked, do share them with me as well!", "content_size_bytes": 1124}
