Sitting at a light in my truck the light bulb in my head went off. I’m thinking to myself, is that the password? I got home and tried it and sure enough I got into the keepass database and inside it had the true crypt volume password. I couldn’t believe I still had 1.3 bitcoin in there.

According to Booth, Bitcoin autonomously reprices global assets—a process that shifts purchasing power in favor of individuals rather than centralized authorities.

I understand that IBIT charges a 0.25% expense ratio, which seems relatively low.

There was Cypher, a quiet genius whose decentralized ledger system had been crushed by regulatory iron fists. Then Ghost, a cryptography expert whose peer-to-peer digital cash, while revolutionary, had been swiftly deplatformed. Oracle, a data scientist with an uncanny ability to predict market shifts, had seen her algorithmic currency collapse under the weight of a coordinated government attack. Spark, a master of network infrastructure, had built a file-sharing service inspired by the early days of Napster—a true peer-to-peer exchange where users connected directly, sharing music without central control. But just like Napster, his creation was eventually suffocated by legal battles and corporate pressure. And finally, Shadow, a visionary architect whose ambitious digital gold project had been deemed a national security threat and summarily dismantled.\n\nEach had tasted the bitter ashes of digital ambition, their individual currencies — elegant, innovative, and ahead of their time — either failing to gain traction or being systematically suppressed. The world, it seemed, wasn't ready for true financial freedom, or so the official narratives declared. But they, the digital exiles, knew better. They knew it was about control.\nTheir frustration had reached a boiling point after the most recent global financial crisis. While millions of ordinary people lost their homes, their jobs, and their life savings in the aftermath of the market crash, the very big banks responsible for the chaos not only survived but, astonishingly, profited from the bailouts and the subsequent market recovery. The audacity of it, the blatant injustice, fueled their resolve.\n\n“We need something…untraceable,” Cypher typed, his words appearing almost instantaneously across their encrypted chat. “Something that can’t be manipulated by the very systems that crashed the world and then lined their pockets.”\n\n“Immutable,” Ghost added. “Beyond the reach of any single entity, and designed to thrive even when central powers falter.”\nOracle, ever the pragmatist, chimed in, “And it needs to be self-sustaining. No central point of failure to exploit, no single executive board to bribe or threaten.”\n\nSpark, remembering the sheer power of Napster's early, unfettered peer-to-peer network, added, “And truly peer-to-peer, like the old days. No intermediaries, no gatekeepers. Just direct exchange between individuals, just as it was meant to be for information, and now, for value.”\nShadow, whose previous project had been so thoroughly eradicated, was the most insistent on one critical detail: “Anonymity. Absolute, unyielding anonymity. For us, and for the system itself. This time, they won’t even know who to shut down.”\n\nAnd so, their collective endeavor began. They toiled in the digital shadows, their individual expertise weaving into a tapestry of unprecedented complexity. Cypher laid the foundational blockchain, a distributed, tamper-proof ledger. Ghost crafted the intricate cryptographic puzzles that would secure each transaction. Oracle devised the incentive mechanisms that would encourage widespread participation without central oversight, ensuring the network's resilience. Spark engineered the robust peer-to-peer connections, drawing lessons from the strengths and weaknesses of early file-sharing, to create a network that could not be centralized or shut down. And Shadow, ever vigilant, designed the underlying architecture, ensuring its resilience against any attack, any shutdown.\n\nMonths blurred into a relentless cycle of coding, testing, and refining. They argued, they celebrated small victories, and they pushed each other to new heights of innovation. Their creation took shape, a digital phantom built on the principles of trustlessness and mathematical proof. There were no founders’ shares, no pre-mined coins, no single point of control. It was designed to be a gift to the world, a digital organism that, once unleashed, would live and breathe on its own.\n\nFinally, the day arrived. A short, unassuming white paper was published online, signed simply, Natoshi Sakamoto. It detailed a revolutionary new form of electronic cash, a peer-to-peer system that promised to liberate finance from the grip of institutions, a system that no market crash could enrich big banks from. The initial reactions were mixed: skepticism from the established financial world, curiosity from a small contingent of tech enthusiasts.\nThe five watched from their separate, hidden corners of the globe as the first blocks were mined, as the first transactions were made. They saw their vision begin to breathe, fueled by the very users it was designed to empower. They remained in the shadows, their identities fiercely guarded, their past failures and the recent outrageous profits of the big banks a constant reminder of the necessity of their anonymity.\nYears passed. The digital currency they had forged, once dismissed as a fringe experiment, slowly but surely began to permeate the global consciousness. Its value soared, its network expanded, and its name became synonymous with a new era of financial possibility.\nAnd as the world marvelled at the enigmatic creator of this phenomenon, perpetually wondering who was behind the name Natoshi Sakamoto, Cypher, Ghost, Oracle, Spark, and Shadow exchanged silent, knowing glances across the vast, secure digital expanse. They were a team of nerds, bound by past failures and a shared vision, who had indeed created a cryptocurrency. And that cryptocurrency was Citboin.", "content_size_bytes": 5695}

Let me walk you through my reasoning, based on the research I’ve done, and explain why I believe this is a smart move for my financial future.\n\n### My Journey into Bitcoin’s Growth\nBitcoin’s story is nothing short of remarkable. Back in 2010, one Bitcoin was worth just $0.30. By the end of 2024, it had soared to $103,332.30, and on January 1, 2025, it was valued at $98,000. That’s an incredible journey for a digital currency that started as an experiment! What draws me to Bitcoin is its unique design: a decentralized system, a fixed supply of 21 million coins, and its growing acceptance as both a store of value and a medium of exchange.\n\nWhen I looked at Bitcoin’s historical data from 2010 to 2024, I calculated an average annual growth rate, or Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR), of about 147.7% over 14 years, from $0.30 in 2011 to $98,000 in 2025. That means a tiny investment back then would have grown exponentially. But I’m realistic—I know those astronomical growth rates won’t last forever. As Bitcoin matures, its percentage growth is slowing down, a phenomenon called diminishing returns. That’s why I’ve taken a closer look at how Bitcoin’s growth is likely to evolve and how I can still benefit.\n\n### Accounting for Diminishing Returns\nTo make a more realistic projection, I moved away from assuming constant exponential growth. Instead, I used a power-law model to capture Bitcoin’s historical price trends. After analyzing the data, I found that Bitcoin’s price can be approximated by the formula **P(t) = 0.221 * t^4.681**, where **t** is the number of years since 2010. This model shows that while Bitcoin’s price keeps rising, the annual percentage growth decreases over time—for example, from 31.2% in 2024 to about 12.6% by 2046. This makes sense: as Bitcoin’s market cap grows and adoption stabilizes, the wild percentage jumps of the early days give way to steadier, but still significant, growth.\n\nThis model gives me confidence that Bitcoin remains a promising investment, even if it won’t repeat the thousand-fold gains of its infancy. The absolute price increases are still substantial, which is why I’m excited about getting in now.\n\n### My Investment Plan\nHere’s my plan: starting on January 30, 2026, when I’m 30 years old, I’ll invest €10—or $11.65, based on an exchange rate of 1.165 USD/EUR—every week in Bitcoin. I’ll keep this up for 20 years, until January 30, 2046, when I turn 50. That’s 1,040 weeks, or a total investment of €10,400. Using my power-law model, I estimate Bitcoin’s price in 2026 will be around $242,746. By 2046, it could reach approximately $4.84 million per Bitcoin.\n\nEach week, I’ll buy a small fraction of Bitcoin at the prevailing price. Over 20 years, I calculate I’ll accumulate about 0.0209 Bitcoin. By 2046, that would be worth around $101,100, or roughly €86,780 at the same exchange rate. That’s nearly nine times my total investment! Compare that to a savings account or even many stock investments, and it’s clear why I’m so enthusiastic about this strategy.\n\n### Why I Think This Is a Great Idea\nSo, why am I committing to this weekly €10 investment in Bitcoin? Here are my reasons:\n\n1. **Minimizing Risk with Dollar-Cost Averaging**: By investing a fixed amount each week, I’m using a strategy called dollar-cost averaging. This means I buy Bitcoin whether the price is high or low, reducing the risk of bad timing. Even with Bitcoin’s volatility, this approach smooths out my average purchase price over time.\n\n2. **Affordability**: €10 a week is manageable for me. It’s like skipping a couple of coffees or a takeout meal. I don’t need a huge upfront sum to get started, which makes Bitcoin accessible and practical.\n\n3. **Long-Term Growth Potential**: Even with diminishing returns, my model suggests Bitcoin’s price will continue to climb significantly over the next two decades. The power-law projection shows it could reach millions of dollars per coin, driven by its scarcity and growing global adoption.\n\n4. **Hedge Against Inflation**: In a world where traditional currencies often lose value due to inflation, Bitcoin is often called “digital gold.” I see it as a way to protect my wealth over the long term, especially as central banks continue printing money.\n\n### Acknowledging the Risks\nI’m not naive—Bitcoin isn’t a sure bet. Its price has seen massive drops, like the 80.5% crash from 2017 to 2018. Regulatory changes, technological disruptions, or competition from other cryptocurrencies could impact its future. My calculations also assume a constant USD/EUR exchange rate, which might not hold true. That’s why I’m only investing what I can afford to lose and keeping my portfolio diversified. But the potential upside, even with moderated growth, makes this a risk I’m willing to take.\n\n### My Conclusion\nI believe that investing €10 in Bitcoin every week is a smart, accessible, and potentially transformative financial decision. My research shows that a modest €10,400 investment could grow to nearly €87,000 by 2046, even accounting for Bitcoin’s diminishing returns. That’s the power of consistent, long-term investing in an asset with a unique value proposition. I’m excited to be part of Bitcoin’s journey, and I encourage anyone looking for a way to build wealth over time to consider a similar approach. Let’s seize this opportunity and see where Bitcoin takes us in the years ahead!\n\n\n\nI thought he did really well and thought maybe someone would appreciate reading it. His estimate for 2046 is 4.84million USD per BTC 😉.Sorry if offtopic, otherwise Thank you!", "content_size_bytes": 5938}

The crypto topic came up and I became interested. My parents gave me a junior bank card so I could even spend money online when I receive some from them. I didn’t get into too much research, I just wanted to dive in with a little amount. I registered on Coinbase and went on to buy BTC. The last step was to give my card info. Turns out my bank didn’t have a SWIFT code(hungarian bank) at the time, the transaction was rejected and I just said fuck this and back to gaming. I wasn’t even thinking about asking my parents because they were at that period where you don’t give out credit card info on “shady” sites because they steal your credit card info!!!! That’s why I got a bank account in the first place. After that I kinda forgot about all this and I stepped into the market before the big bull run during COVID, but I never bought BTC, only altcoins and I regret not buying some. I see the whole picture now. I used to tell collegues how close I was buying Bitcoin, could have been a life changing amount of money and I just didn’t realise. I only wanted to get this out, I always see posts from this sub when you finally sell your big stack to help out in this crazy world and I think to myself that this could have been me as well, but what do I know?

And while searching and reading some posts about the fountains and the appearance of Bitcoin-QT, I remebered I used this.\n\nI made my first contact with bitcoin at our colleges computer course, where SHA 256 was used as an example to create hashes for password checks. To be honest, I did not pay attention too much because I did not want to become a software developer. Nevertheless our teacher was very invested in Bitcoin and mentioned it several times as an example for the usage of hashes. Must have been in the semester 2009/2010. During the summer I gave it a chance and started mining..if I remember correctly I stopped after 1 Block because it took me a week to mine and my parents argued about a pc running without usage. Since it was pretty worthless at that time i gave in and stopped and forgot. So i ignored the several all time highs and cryptowinter and really forgot about my bitcoin episode. I moved out switched to laptops and forgot about our old rig. \n\nDuring the pandemic I had so much time again to read and check on \"geek\" news that I was amazed how fast the value rose during the pandemic and decided to try to solve some puzzles. This was the start when I actually tried to understand bitcoin and its network. And of course shadowly remembered my brief experiments with bitcoin. As I had my laptops HDDs stored I searched them for the wallet.dat files to see if I was lucky finding a small fortune. Of course I did not find anything and was a little unhappy to be honest. \n\nBut life did go on and I mourned my decision not to buy Bitcoin in 2015/16 at 500$ when we discussed in economics course about currencies more, since I concluded my memory must have been wrong since I did not find any bitcoin related directory on my HDDs. \n\n  \nFast forward to last year, when I decided that it would be the time to buy a house. I realized how inflated the property prices are, even in small towns, not to speak about big cities. And of course my interest in a treasure like sunken bitcoins rose again and I puzzled everything together and realized I must have made the mining test on our family rig. When asking my parents about, they said they scrapped all PCs since but kept the HDDs, my heart jumped a little and i scanned alls HDDs for the bitcoin directory....and found nothing and the data was as well not reaching back to 2009. \n\nBut my father remembered that he gave one PC to my Grandpa so he could check on his grandchildrens sports results and some local news. And that this PC was stored in a moving box under the roof of their house. So I got the box, started the system and it was still working. But the Hdds had been wiped for a clean windows install. No old data was present on the system partition. Desperately I started with a data recovery tool and was able to locate the bitcoin directory. Even with a wallet dat. So my heart pounded as you might imagine. Only to realize that the file is corrupted beyond repair. I cloned the HDD and tried various means of repair, but the file is said to have 0 kb of size. So I guess this time for real that I have become a provider of scarcity for all who hodled long enough. \n\nIt was hard to learn, that the file has been corrupted, and defacto lost, and yes after my tries we tried with professional help too but it seems that the formatting of the HDD did its magic and since it was not a large system partition, it might have been overwritten at some point. Maybe it is good that way because the wallet was not encrypted (at least i dont remember doing it) and maybe it was already compromised long time ago. \n\nBut at least i learned that my grandpa had a collection of pictures of all his grandkids on the desktop. Which seems to be the only folder created on desktop besides a internet exlorer with bookmarks for our sportclubs. So i got this going for me.\n\nBut to quit the dream of buying a house from crypto was hard nevertheless. \n\n  \nThanks for reading and I hope my mistakes helps others to cope with theirs", "content_size_bytes": 4406}

Trade slowed, taxes couldn’t be collected, and productivity dropped. But once silver started flowing in from the New World, the economy revived. People say, “They became rich again.” But why? Silver isn’t food, it’s not a tool—it’s just a medium.\n\nThe truth is: what really matters isn’t the silver itself, but the speed and efficiency of value exchange it enables. When people can trade faster and more freely, resources are used better. Productivity goes up, innovation accelerates, and civilization advances.\n\nAnd today, we’re seeing a similar shift—with digital currencies and blockchain.\n\nThey’re not just about speculation—they're about redefining trust, reducing friction, and pushing value exchange to a new level across borders and systems.\n\nIf you have any other thoughts or perspectives, feel free to share them in the comments below.

Kind of stuck here, I was trying to make sure I could send money from the app to strikes. However when I do, since I only have a few dollars the Green app says “fee change below dust threshold”.

I’d hate to have to put in 500 dolllars in and find out I’ve messed the process up and lose that money.

USDT dominates the scene with 83% adoption and is the most trusted stablecoin in the region. This isn’t just passive holding. {eople are staking, trading, investing, and actively engaged with Web3 dapps and platforms.\n\n\nBut when it comes to actually spending crypto in the real world, usage drops off a cliff. Only 37% have used crypto for real-world purchases, and even fewer report a smooth experience. High fees, poor infrastructure, and fragmented tools are the norm, according to them.\n\n\nThis is the paradox: a crypto-native country that wants to use stablecoins daily, but can’t. If it’s this hard in a market as advanced as Brazil, what does that say for the rest of the world? My guess is that this is where L2 chains will step in and solve the problem. Fees and speed seem to be the main drawbacks and we all know that L2s can offer both, with the security of Ethereum.\n\n\nAnyone else seeing this in other regions?

That’s what makes compatibility possible.\n\nEven outdated ILs must be considered by builders, so ordering between duties isn’t critical.\n\n**Slot Flow with ePBS + FOCIL.**\n\nAnd this is how a post-ePBS world looks like:\n\n• Slot N–1:Includers broadcast and bulid ILs:  \n→ Attesters freeze views.  \n→ Proposer freezes ILs, builds payload satisfying ILs.\n\n• Slot N:Proposer runs fork-choice rule.  \n→ Picks builder payload.  \n→ Attesters check IL compliance before voting.\n\n**Split Enforcement Design.**\n\nTwo options for verifying inclusion lists:\n\n**A. Attesters (Slot N).**  \nThey check if all known ILs were respected in the builder’s bitlist.  \n• Leverages full committee.  \n• Can lead to block reorgs if bitlist is incomplete.\n\n**B.

Any attempt to somehow build on an infinite number of forks because double-signing is possible (whereas in PoW it is impossible) will not lead to the honest majority following along, as those \"alternative forks\" will never become the \"longest\" (in terms of least skipped) chain. So in order to actually pull of an attack based on that you have \"nothing at stake\" you need to be the majority, i.e., >51%. Whenever you are the majority, you are already free to attack the network as you want as nothing protects it against 51% attack, the security model in Nakamoto consensus (or traditional solution to Byzantine Generals Problem) is an *honest majority*. Given this, you can also notice that the reason Satoshi used PoW was *not* because double-signing was impossible, it was probably primarily because it has random validator selection built in (whereas with proof-of-stake you need to also solve random number generation), and much like the ancient Greeks Kleroterion it is the \"democratic lottery\" that was the basis of Nakamoto consensus. Bootstrapping a proof-of-stake system back in 2009 would have been a lot more complicated. From that you can notice that those who shouted about \"nothing at stake\" because \"there was something at stake in PoW\" may have misunderstood things, they assumed the \"no double signatures\" was somehow essential but it was probably not the feature that made PoW ideal for a first version of \"democratic lottery\" to control a computer platform.\n\n**Edit:** \"balance attacks\" is what many assume is detrimental if there is \"nothing-at-stake\". With the fork choice rule `(blockheight-skipped)` and fixed slot times (and assuming a validator order is pre-decided for a \"period\" of N blocks or days or similar), even starting such an attack (managing to get two forks that partition the validator pool) requires that the attacker has two slots in succession. This happens fairly often for attacker that is something like 5-15% of all stake. The attacker then has to skip two slots on the honest chain, X+1 and X+2 while  creating an attacker chain where they claim that the honest validator at block heigh X skipped their slot. At block height X+2, the attacker chain will then have a score of 1 point more than the honest chain. The automatic fork choice rule will then cause part of the validator pool to start to follow the attacker chain. Then, the attacker can try and do a \"balance attack\" by skipping slots selectively on whichever fork starts to get more and more validators to converge on it. To achieve this attempt at an attack, the attacker first has to pay two slots (i.e., not get block reward for two slots) and they then have to continuously pay slots as they skip slots to attempt to maintain a \"balance attack\".\n\nThe way \"nothing at stake\" is typically described, it is assumed most of the validator pool will simply choose to build on all possible forks and not use the fork choice rule (i.e., use a modified client that skips the fork choice rule and accepts all forks as valid). This assumption seems completely wrong. But, a \"balance attack\" is theoretically probably possible, but that is not where emphasis is usually placed when \"nothing-at-stake\" problem is described. The \"balance attack\" seems extremely convoluted, and being able to somehow \"steer\" a validator pool partition so that there is never convergence on one fork seems a bit like trying to sail against the wind. My post here was downvoted into oblivion (actually an 18% upvote rate at the moment! and there was at least a number of upvotes so that is quite a few downvotes on an already invisible post!), but to me it seems like the problem might be exaggerated. So-called \"slashing\" or some kind of penalty can of course deter it, if the problem is realistic, and that is already used with PoS Ethereum. But to me the threat does seem exaggerated.\n\nAnd to consider spontaneous forks that an attacker can operate on to do \"balance attacks\", the emergence of such spontaneous forks is low probability to start with. It requires one validator to be \"near the deadline\" when publishing their slot, so that the next validator assumes they skipped, and it requires that the next validator was allocated two slots in succession. Then, the fork will start to attract validators from the validator pool via the fork choice rule. Such a situation is low probability, meaning most forks for \"balance attacks\" have to be initiated manually at a cost of two skipped blocks (and no guarantee of successful attack, as such attack does not seem easy at all, and has a constant cost from having to skip blocks as that is the *only way to balance points* between the two forks).\n\nFactor in the fork choice rule that given equivalent \"points\" it is the smaller block height that wins, and the probability of a spontaneous fork is even lower. It is not nothing but it is very small, so most \"balance attacks\" would have to be manually initiated forks, and then you have a cost of two skipped blocks to start with, with no guarantee of a successful attack, and unclear gain from succeeding the attack (many hypothetical benefits such as double spending and similar but in the case of such ongoing attack no exchange would accept \"finality\" anyway, and the attack is always very apparent as you end up with only half the validators signing blocks...)\n\n    // Local and external difficulty is identical.\n    // Second clause in the if statement reduces the vulnerability to selfish mining.\n    // Please refer to http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ie53/publications/btcProcFC.pdf\n    reorg := externTd.Cmp(localTD) > 0\n    tie := externTd.Cmp(localTD) == 0\n    if tie {\n        externNum, localNum := extern.Number.Uint64(), current.Number.Uint64()\n        if externNum < localNum {\n            reorg = true\n        } else if externNum == localNum {\n            var currentPreserve, externPreserve bool\n            if f.preserve != nil {\n                currentPreserve, externPreserve = f.preserve(current), f.preserve(extern)\n            }\n            reorg = !currentPreserve && (externPreserve || f.rand.Float64() < 0.5)\n        }\n    }\n\nYou also have very clear way to see that an attack is happening (otherwise convergence would happen... so it is easy to see) and when it started and who started it. So manually siding with the \"honest chain\" is quite easy, probably.\n\n\"Slashing\" is pretty straight forward and easy to add as a safeguard even if the \"nothing-at-stake\" problem is exaggerated, but I do think it might be exaggerated. I am also not sure if the model where each block has a \"score\" in proportion to the stake of the person who signs it (assuming some PoS systems work like that) is very good, as they get massively amplified influence (one, higher probability of being selected, and two, more \"points\" for each block they produce also) but maybe most systems do not use that?", "content_size_bytes": 7109}

I am the inventor of Bitpeople (dot) org that was invented between 2015 and 2018 in collaboration with \"bitnation\" (I since distanced myself from \"bitnation\" because their vision is wrong, I can specify how if anyone is interested). It was originally called Virtual Pseudonym Parties or Online Pseudonym Parties, then for a short time Pseudonym Pairs. I also built a people-vote consensus engine a year and a half ago (under my Swedish foundation Panarchy foundation that also develops Bitpeople), and have now spent half a year solving the \"reserved payment attack\" in multiphop payments (this is not under my foundation, it is part of a separate and older project called Resilience as it required such a solution).\n\nThe \"Achilles heal\" in Bitpeople is the man-in-the-middle attack and this has been very openly communicated since 2020-something probably. There are many different ways to solve it (i.e., to establish a secure channel). I have left the problem open over the past 5 years or so, and prioritized things such as\n\nI think one of the most secure might be the \"lock & key\" video chat handshake. It is quite simple. Both people in the pair commit (encrypt and share with the other person) a video plus their public key. At this point, the two people know absolutely nothing about one another, as they are registered with laundered keys that cannot be traced to the previous month's event. They then do the video event, and after, they reveal their committed video + public key.\n\nA bit like a \"hash lock\" but with video. I have considered similar ideas over past 5 years, and wanted to mention it here if anyone is interested.\n\n***On the \"but AI\" issue:*** *1-on-1 video chat is the most secure \"digital Turing test\" there is. Of course, a hypothetical science fiction technological singularity would break it but then such a system could grow a retina more easily or probably build replica androids indistinguishable from people too so at that point most proof-of-unique-human systems collapse anyway - I only mention this science fiction scenario as some people here believe it is already real, and those people typically tend to believe the neuron-transistor analogy, that biology settled for transistors that are 10000x the diameter of our technological ones and that Moore's law somehow did not apply in biology, but I do not think that is a reasonable assumption at all. Rather the transistor is probably protein-scale, like tubulin which is 4.5x8 nm. I love AI, use it all the time and have been very interested in it since Watson won Jeopardy in 2011.*", "content_size_bytes": 2585}

After so many years in crypto, I’ve seen the scams, the hype, the empty tokens - and I get why you need to protect the community. Without some kind of filter, the noise would drown everything else out.\n\nThat said, I also believe Ethereum only stays relevant if people actually build on it. And if nobody ever gets to show what they’re building, it gets kind of hard to stay motivated. I’ve seen a few posts recently where people shared something they built (not in a spammy way), and it made me wonder: what’s the actual boundary here?\n\nWe’ve built something we really believe adds value - no token, no “financial incentives”, just a product solving a very real-world problem. Fully onchain, source-available, audited, self-custody - the kind of thing Ethereum was made for.\n\nWe’re not looking to farm attention or sell anything. We’d just love to be able to show the community what’s possible with Ethereum today - and maybe get a bit of feedback too.\n\nSo, my question is: how is Rule 9 applied in practice? Is there any room for honest builders to share what they’ve created, as long as it’s not marketing fluff?\n\nIf not, I’ll fully respect that. Just thought it was worth asking.\n\nThanks for keeping this place clean and thoughtful - I know that’s not easy.\n\n\\- someone who still believes in building", "content_size_bytes": 1499}

The goal is to enhance efficiency and trust in the network.\n\n**What's mechanism?**\n\nEIP-7732 separates block validation into two parts:\n\n* Consensus validation (by proposers)\n* Execution validation (by builders)\n\nBlock validation now happens in two steps: proposers check network rules first, then builders provide and verify the full transaction data.\n\n**Why is this needed?**\n\nToday, most Ethereum validators outsource block construction to third-party builders via a trusted relay. This introduces risks as:\n\n• Trust assumptions.  \n• Higher latency.  \n• Missed attestations.\n\n**How does it work?**\n\nInstead of including a full execution payload, proposers include a signed commitment from a builder.\n\nLater, the builder must reveal the actual payload matching that commitment.\n\nProposers get paid if the builder behaves correctly, even if they don’t trust each other.\n\n**What’s this Payload Timeliness Committee?**\n\nA subset of validators now checks whether builders revealed their promised payloads on time.\n\nThey don’t need to check the payload’s validity, just that the right data showed up when expected.\n\nThis offloads critical work away from attestations.\n\n**Benefits of EIP-7732:**\n\n• Improved security.  \n• Greater efficiency and speed.  \n• Enhanced reliability.  \n• Better scalability.\n\n**Any changes to the Execution Layer?**\n\nNope, this EIP is purely at the consensus level.\n\nThis proposal is a foundational step toward a modular Ethereum and it’s a reflection of network's commitment to long-term reliability and trustlessness.\n\n**If you looking for a reliable way to delegate your ETH**, with proven performance and consistent dependability, **Everstake** is a staking solution you can count on.", "content_size_bytes": 2135}

For the past 20 years, most modern systems use what I call \"2-phase commit that cancels on timeout\". Ryan Fugger was an early pioneer of such systems, and he always planned for to solve a problem the protocol had (he planned to make the penalty \"chunked\") but this was not possible to achieve without causing new problems. I managed to \"transcend\" that problem with the 3-phase commit I describe in the linked video.\n\nWith multihop payments perfected, Ethereum Raiden would be practical, as would Interledger or anything else (I am mostly interested in trust-backed multihop as what Ryan described 20 years ago already, but also good that Lightning Network or anything else could take off).", "content_size_bytes": 1183}

I didn't ship a dApp. I don't code.  I learned to program in LISP at university, which has given me a phobia of unclosed parentheticals but not much in the way of practical relevance.\n\nFor reasons that I don't think I can adequately explain, I decided that I wanted to take part in a hackathon *anyway*. I figured I'd spend 48 hours writing weird, Ethereum-aligned fiction. I even created KPIs:\n\n* One completed story I was proud of\n* One person telling me that they liked it\n* One moment where I felt like I belonged.\n\nI submitted a Taikai application that made my plan extremely clear. Four days later, I was accepted, along with a flight from ETHPrague and the promise of free food during the build. I took this to mean they understood and approved of my plan.\n\nThis was my first mistake.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k046l94rkt9f1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=51d38dac12e1a068c6cddea6762eac633547df3e\n\nI spent most of the two days and nights surrounded by unnervingly clever young men and women working in intense little teams, competing for €60,000 in bounties. I didn't want a bounty. I just wanted to finish something that I could share; partly for professional pride, mostly because I'd staked 0.05 ETH for a wristband and a place at the table, which would only be returned if I submitted a valid project. \n\n*Valid* was doing a lot of heavy lifting, here.\n\nI wrote directly into a GitHub repository, every thought committed in real-time to prove that the stories were conceived and written during the event. I lived on the (surprisingly good) conference buffet.\n\nI stayed at the venue until midnight the first night and got up again at 4am; my anxiety-driven insomnia finally useful.\n\nI challenged myself to include the Hackathon bounty givers, tagging them on my project notes. No one noticed. Still, I had great fun tucking a story into iExec code templates about a guy writing a heartbroken letter to his ex, passively-aggressively formatted as software. I called it *Breakup as a Service*. I spent a ludicrous amount of time formatting the code to look just right, even though it didn't do anything.\n\nAnother was an intentionally ridiculous letter written by a Hackathon participant who's absolutely certain that cleaning whiteboards and offering positive energy makes them integral to a team that hasn't noticed them.\n\n>To: The Belgrade Judging Committee  \nSubject: Prize Distribution Appeal  \nI am submitting this formal appeal to be retroactively included as a member of Team *Rebase And Chill*. While I was not listed as an official team member, I am assuming that the omission was administrative, not intentional.\n\nIt was very meta. But to complete the hackathon, I didn't just need to submit a project; I needed to present a five-minute pitch of my product. My pitch, I decided, would be to read this story aloud. I've done a lot of readings and I was pretty sure the story would take about four minutes, leaving me one minute to introduce myself and explain what I was doing. If I spoke quickly, I might even get ten seconds on the importance of fiction in tech. But this is shoved into the pile of things to worry about after I've submitted my project.\n\nBy the evening of the second day, the other teams were in tense discussions to get their apps working and filming polished demo videos in odd corners of the Sava Centar.\n\nI created a pretty PDF of five stories that I decided were complete, another word doing some very heavy lifting, and wasted two hours making a pretty cover. At the last minute, I included a page of completely pointless project metrics.\n\n* Stories finished: 5\n* Words written: \\~9,000\n* Useful words extracted: 2,607\n* Existential crises: 2.5\n* Coffee: insufficient\n* Steps (mostly pacing around the Sava Centar): 23,248\n* Meaningful glances from judges: 3 (estimated, unreliable)\n* GitHub commits: 71\n* Commits containing profanity: 3\n* Hackathon backers mentioned: 5/9\n\nThat night, I discovered that the demo video wasn't optional: it was a requirement for getting my stake back. I retreated to my accommodation, sleep-deprived and muttering. After a few hours of fitful rest, I made a loom video of the PDF with a voice-over that sounded like I was slowly disintegrating.\n\nI submitted it with fifteen minutes to spare.\n\nThis was about the time that Taikai crashed, which I'm choosing to believe wasn't personal. It sounded like the conference center was chaos so I stayed in my room. I was supposed to pitch this thing, like a real product. I needed an introductory statement. I needed to rehearse reading the story. I probably should've made PowerPoint slides but there was definitely no time for that. Somehow, I had to explain my art to a crowd who were expecting to check if my code would compile.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cq4yxmn3lt9f1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8818ce118cc7c880c001bca90b5501af4034186a\n\nThe easy first step was to practice my story so that I would know how long it took to read. Before I began, I glanced at the official Discord channel. My heart sank. The pitch sessions would start an hour after submission deadline, it said. I’d already blown half of that on spiraling. Someone posted a spreadsheet with all the teams. I was 7th. I grabbed my stuff and ran to the Sava Centar, arriving at five past.\n\nThe spreadsheet showed team number three as “in the room”, which I took to mean pitching, giving me twenty glorious minutes to grab a pastry and cobble together an intro. But then the status line vanished. I abandoned the coffee queue and marched up to the desk in front of the conference hall to ask how I’d know when it was me.\n\n[Photo by SimonaSerban.eth](https://preview.redd.it/w8uoywb6lt9f1.jpg?width=482&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=29582e2f927da349bae978fa91de390b39d5ae97)\n\nThey scanned the spreadsheet and told me I should just go in and wait  my turn. Right. No pastry. No coffee. No prep. But at least I’d get to  hear other people’s pitches and work out what I was supposedly meant to  be doing.\n\nI walked in to find clusters of people all over the  room. Some were sitting at small tables facing the wall. A small crowd  huddled near the stage; I assumed they were the team currently pitching. Someone tapped me on the shoulder and whispered the format: I had five minutes to speak. She’d wave when my time was up so that we could have three  minutes for the Q&A. I nodded and asked in a whisper where I should  sit. She pointed to a table where two men were engrossed in their  laptops. There wasn’t much room but I sat down across from them, pulling  out my notebook. I settled in. I smiled politely at the two men across  from me. One, a friendly looking man with a thick beard, smiled back.  The other never looked up. I leafed through my scribbled pages and began  rooting around in my pockets for my pen.\n\nAbout ninety seconds passed before the friendly one with the beard looked at me and spoke at full volume, as if we weren’t in a room full of people nervously  pitching their projects.\n\n“So,” he said.\n\n*Rude*, I thought.\n\nA brief pause and he continued. “Do you want to start?”\n\nI blinked and then froze in horror. “Is this my pitch session?”\n\nBoth stared at me and nodded. Yes. Yes, it was.\n\nI  opened my mouth and closed it again, hoping the floor might swallow me  whole. I mumbled something incoherent about fiction before closing my  mouth again firmly. FriendlyBeardGuy asked me if I had a Github repo. I  did! I spelled out t-w-e-l-v-e-m-e-a-t-b-a-l-l-s and they each pulled up my repository on their laptops and began rummaging through my files. That flicker of relief vanished: This was exactly the wrong place to start.\n\nI tried to explain that the repo was full of stories. They looked up from their laptops and then down again.\n\nMr Serious broke the silence. “So you have no code?”\n\nA tiny shake of my head.\n\n“Is there an app?”\n\nAnother tiny shake.\n\nHe  glanced at his screen, as if retracing the steps that had led him here.  He looked like a man who’d arrived at the wrong meeting, the wrong  building, possibly the wrong profession, but was too polite to say “What  the hell is this?”\n\nI stared at the floor as I explained that I was going to read them a story.\n\nHeavy silence, as if I were a cat offering them a dead bird.\n\nI  fumbled for my phone to find the file, which I had not yet actually ever read aloud. I tripped over the title like it was a loose paving  stone. Both men stared at my repo as if a user manual might appear.\n\nI took a deep breath and read the next line, where the story was  addressed to the judging committee. FriendlyBeardGuy looked up, puzzled. Was I talking to him?\n\nAt least he was listening. I kept going, half hoping the floor would reconsider.\n\nAs  I got to the bit about the participant wiping the whiteboard that no  one had used, Mr Serious glitched, his face shifting into something that  might have been a smile. That tiny spark was all I needed. I kept  reading, my confidence growing. The woman from the start walked over,  hovering behind the men. She held out a flat hand, lifting it up and  down. I stopped, stared at her in confusion. She made a wavey motion.\n\nOh *shit.*  I was reading competently, finally, which meant that I was using a public reading voice for an easily-distractable audience. My mother would have called it my outdoor voice;  meanwhile other people were in there doing their own  pitches, probably wondering what the hell was wrong with me. “I’m so, so sorry,” I said. “I didn’t mean to be so loud.”\n\n“No, no,” she said, looking almost as confused as my judges. “Just your five minutes are up.”\n\n*That’s it*?  I looked at her and then at the men. This was the signal for the three-minute Q&A, a nightmare from which I might never recover.  Maybe one of the questions would be “How does the story end?”\n\nFriendlyBeardGuy  smiled at me the way you smile at someone having a psychotic episode  and said, “Don’t worry” in a soothing voice. I took this to mean I  should keep reading. Somehow, I made it to the end of the story. “Thank  you,” I said in a gravelly voice.\n\nBoth of them stared at the middle distance without a word. I could only have made this worse by offering to tell the whole story in interpretive dance. The floor  beneath me remained disappointingly solid.\n\nMr Serious lifted his laptop and turned it towards me, showing me my repo. “I found code,” he said.\n\n*Breakup as a Service*  glowed on the screen. I gritted my teeth and attempted to speak through  them. “It’s a story about a guy who is trying to use code templates to  write software but he’s lying to himself and really just writing to his  ex-girlfriend.”\n\nThis did not help to clear things up.\n\n[Excerpt from Breakup as a Service](https://preview.redd.it/gjmnvjeclt9f1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=38404e4ac88a82e1779a487b449da2565a37a9f5)\n\nHe scrolled through the file. “So, this won’t run?”\n\n“No.”  Right now, this was the only thing that I was confident on. “It’s pure  vibe coding. I wrote it with AI. I showed it to a dev friend to check  the syntax but he refused.”\n\nFriendlyBeardGuy nodded in sympathy with my unknown friend.\n\n”There’s  a PDF,” I said. “Of all the stories. That’s probably easier to read  than the Github repo.” They both nodded pleasantly. They were never  going to read the PDF.\n\n”That was a very enjoyable story to hear,” said FriendlyBeardGuy. We were finished.\n\nI stumbled out and started laughing. Someone turned to stare, but after the last ten minutes, it barely even registered.\n\nIt was over. At least for me.\n\nMr Serious was probably still staring at my code, hoping it would eventually explain itself.\n\nIn that regard, he and I had a lot in common.\n\n\\---\n\nThis one's a bonus article, because I love you.

Liberty finance . Swap)\n\nI’ll break down the 3 best things in crypto land and what Richard Heart saw in them that could be tweaked to be perfect.\n\n1) Bitcoin.  People wanted to earn yield, so they gave their Bitcoin to exchanges for the promise of 5% yield.  Guess what, those exchanges got hacked and ppl lost their BTC.  Guess who warned you of Gemini, Celcius, FTX, etc?  Richard.\n\nHe actually saw this trend before it even started in 2019, and he launched hex in December 2019.  Which was .00001, and it’s still up 100x today.\n\nSo this guy Richard thought, hmmm wouldn’t it be cool if we could earn yield on our bitcoin by just time-locking it?  Meaning, no electricity, no burning our resources, no pollution.  Just the radical idea of instead of proof of work, it’s proof of wait.  \n\nThe money used to buy ASICs, electricity, and the time spent waiting for a block to be mined, this could all be done with a simple contract.  A hybrid proof of stake/ proof of wait.\n\nSo hex is born.\n\n2) Ethereum.  Best product that crypto has offered.  Period.  Bitcoin is cool, but it’s pet rock.  It can’t do sheet.  Ethereum is the bad ass younger brother that made mami and paps proud.  \n\nBut them gas fees yo.  Every bull market has this issue, where it’s so good but no one can use it.\n\nHence why pulsechain was designed to help with ethereum’s load.  It’s not some L2 that is centralized on one dudes node.\n\nIt’s world wide. No one can turn it off.  And it’s faster and cheaper than Ethereum.  So now Ethereum can test all the upgrades that allow hackers to drain your wallets, while Pulsechain can wait to decide if they will implement.  Best of all worlds.  \n\nPulsechain is born.\n\n3) Uniswap.  Did you know uni token should be hundreds of dollars per coin rn?  There’s this neat little feature called the buy and burn, but Hayden is too busy gargling demon semon to flick that switch.  All UNI token holders are getting kucked.\n\nSo Richard made PLSX.  Buy and burn features TURNED ON, and cannot be turned off.  It’s the drunken michael Saylor buying the PLSX token forevermore with every swap that occurs on Pulsechain. \n\nWith $50 mil daily volume, and this is in a bear market, AND everybody hates the chain.  Imagine with some adoption what numbers we could see…\n\n\nSo these are the 3 pillars of crypto that have really pushed the industry forward, but they all lacked a crucial element.  But Richard heart, the mysterious whale who mined bitcoin in 2011, made copies of the best things and gave them the little tweak they needed to be great.\n\n\nRH believes in decentralization, freedom to transact, freedom of middlemen, and freedom to pump to the heavens.\n\nWhat other meme coin can boast such stats?\n\nI like this billionaire crypto dude who likes to make products that are upgrades to the 15 year old tech and are central to the core principles of crypto.  Freedom to transact.\n\nOh ya, and pDAI…. Nvm, you’ll find out soon enough.\n\nSave this post and remind me 1 year from now.", "content_size_bytes": 3583}

I want to build a long-term reserve of USDC, and I already have a **hardware wallet**, which gives me great security for my private keys. However, I'm really torn about which network to use for storing my USDC.\n\nAfter some research, I understand that keeping USDC on the **Ethereum network** would likely be the most secure option, given its unparalleled robustness and decentralization. The downside, though, is the significantly higher cost for sending and moving funds on Ethereum. This makes it quite unattractive for smaller amounts, especially during peak times like a **bull market**, when gas fees can skyrocket.\n\nA promising alternative I've been considering is storing my USDC on **Polygon**. As an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, Polygon offers much lower transaction fees and faster confirmations.\n\nMy main question is: Does the added security of Ethereum justify the high costs for a long-term reserve, or would the practicality and cost-effectiveness of Polygon be an acceptable compromise, especially since I'm already using the protection of a hardware wallet?\n\nI'd really appreciate your insights on this balance between cost and security for HODLing USDC.

This bill aims to bring much-needed regulatory certainty by establishing a clear framework for digital assets — primarily by defining \"digital commodities\" and assigning their oversight to the CFTC.\n\nA core component is the \"maturity test\", which assesses if a blockchain system and its native asset are truly decentralized and utility-driven.

Big players like whales, early investors, and groups working together often start buying tokens a few days before they become popular. If u can spot their moves early, you’re not just guessing you’re following real clues. But here’s the thing: It’s complicated. A single wallet doesn’t tell you much the real value comes from looking at patterns across many wallets. Doing this by hand takes a lot of time. Also there are a lot of fake signals. Some big wallets buy and sell quickly. Others move stablecoins between chains, which might seem promising… but it often doesn’t lead to anything. Besides not all smart money stays smart. Past success doesn’t guarantee future wins. Wallets can get hacked, habits change, and some people who look like winners are just lucky with one good bet. That said, when done right, watching wallets can help you get ahead of the crowd. i’ve seen early moves into tokens that went up 10 times just by understanding their behavior before big volume or social buzz started. Some tools I’ve found useful include:\n\n\\* Solscan / Birdeye: For tracking and seeing how tokens move.\n\n\\* Step Finance: For neat dashboards and visual wallet data.\n\n\\* Solvizor : An AI tool that helps analyze groups of wallets and explains their trading.\n\n\\* Jito stats, dexscreener filters, mempool data: These are more advanced but still worth learning.\n\nI’m curious if anyone here is tracking wallets similarly or using other tools or methods to catch early moves.", "content_size_bytes": 1642}

It shares the same icon and is priced similar to JITOSOL (not sure why since I'm pretty sure it's worthless). I laughed it off, navigated to my Phantom token list, and hid it. As many say, the best way to deal with this shit is ignore it. I tried to burn it on [Incinerator](https://sol-incinerator.com/), but Incinerator couldn't see it, so again, I ignored it. \n\nI believe the scam works like this: The sender looks for people who deal in high volume, sends the fake coin to the owner's wallet address, and hopes the wallet's owner accidentally buys that coin over the real one. \n\nFast forward to today, I accidentally bought it... a lot. I frequently buy/sell on [Matcha.xyz](http://Matcha.xyz) which has a [\"recent\" list](https://i.imgur.com/bzoH5Qr.png), and it kept recommending me Jito Stakde SOL as a coin to move because I had it in my wallet despite me hiding it. The crypto markets are hot, and trying to snipe a deal I bought the wrong Jito. No red flags were raised since the coin is priced similarly and shares the same icon and token abbreviation. \n\nI'm surprised Matcha even allows for this interaction and doesn't warn about it better during the transfer, but oh well. I signed off on it.\n\nIf you're wondering, no I can't seem to sell it. It's weird Matcha allows people to buy into it, but won't allow people to sell it.\n\n\\---\n\n**Lessons to be learned here:**\n\n1.) Do not deal in large volume per transaction. By moving small, it minimizes your loss if something happens. To help force this behavior, consider diversifying into multiple coins. You can still do all SOL, but that doesn't mean you need to have all your eggs in JITOSOL.\n\n2.) If your wallet receives a fake coin, consider creating a new wallet on your same account and move everything over. SOL gas fees are \\~$0.03 anyways and only takes secs to setup a 2nd wallet (in Phantom). Especially important if you think your wallet is compromised.", "content_size_bytes": 2229}

Making that data freely and openly accessible lowers the barrier for independent developers and smaller teams. \n\nYou can type any Solana slot number and pull its full contents. The explorer returns the complete ledger artifact set including transactions, program interactions, token and NFT movements, and full account and program state. \n\nAll data is parsed locally in your browser and you can export results as CSV or JSON for deeper analysis. \n\nIf you are building analytics, compliance tooling, trading models, or simply need verifiable historical inputs, SolanaWave gives you open slot level access to the entire Solana ledger, so you can query any block and validate state without running your own archive infrastructure.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nq3a20l2didf1.png?width=137&format=png&auto=webp&s=d90fd95b0f76d532e7a2bdf8cb7931e675cdf70f\n\n[https://www.solanawave.ai/](https://www.solanawave.ai/)\n\n# 👛 Swig: Smart Wallet Tooling for Solana\n\nIf you've wrestled with seed phrase onboarding just to deliver a friendly UX, or given up on recurring payments because users cannot stay online to sign each transaction, take a look at Swig. \n\nSwig addresses these issues with a programmable, non custodial wallet that lives inside a Solana program and exposes configurable policies instead of raw key access.\n\nIt brings an account abstraction style smart wallet layer to Solana so you can give users an app-centric experience without holding user keys.\n\nWhat Swig gives you:\n\n* **Role scoped permissions**: Grant specific actions to your app, a bot, or a collaborator.\n* **Session based access:** Let users approve once for a defined activity window instead of every transaction.\n* **Automated and conditional transactions**: For subscriptions, streaming, scheduled or event-triggered flows, and delayed settlement.\n* **Social recovery:** Web2 style sign in options to reduce seed phrase friction and support multi guardian recovery.\n\nSwig is live on Solana Mainnet, and documentation, SDKs, and early integration examples are available.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nq3a20l2didf1.png?width=137&format=png&auto=webp&s=d90fd95b0f76d532e7a2bdf8cb7931e675cdf70f\n\n[https://build.onswig.com/](https://build.onswig.com/)\n\n# 🧙 Introducing Magic Router: One Endpoint, Every Environment\n\nMagic Router from MagicBlock gives you a single RPC endpoint that looks at each submitted transaction and decides where to execute it with no extra routing code, toggles, or config in your app.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kkhkwom8didf1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa79b64d0b841e6d12caa88824d7a5c2a2c786dd\n\nRouting is metadata driven. The router inspects the transaction’s writable accounts, checks which are delegated to MagicBlock’s delegation program, then chooses the between Solana or an Ephemeral Rollup for the execution layer. \n\nYou integrate once, users connect and sign once, and the router sends transactions where they will confirm fastest.

And it's not a futures ETF, and the marketing site claims to have exposure to actual on-chain staking. The risk part doesn't talk about tracking risk as an inherent risk of the fund, yet it seems to be a major one in reality. And the fund's fees, while on the high side, don't explain it either.\n\nMaybe the problem has something to do with the '21Shares Solana Staking ETP' that it partly invests in and how that 'product' reports the NAV?\n\nMaybe the lack of oracles in the tradfi side of the setup is the root problem?\n\nI was hopeful that this ETF would be good for helping simplify taxes for staking and opening staking to more institutional money (increasing demand for SOL), but it seems like there are some issues.

This is driving some serious price momentum!\nMarket Buzz: With a 60% surge in the past week and Grayscale monitoring it for institutional interest, $BONK is catching eyes.\nWhat’s your take on $BONK?

SOL dropped from $250 down to under $10 in December 2022, then slowly climbed back to similar highs by November 2024. The pattern looks solid when you zoom out..... and the key level everyone's watching is $170. If SOL breaks above that with strong volume, the first target around $295 is totally reasonable based on how these patterns usually play out.\n\nBut here's where I need to pump the brakes on the $2,700 target. At that price, we're talking about a market cap of roughly $1.4 trillion. To put that in perspective..... Apple sits around $3.5 trillion, so we'd be talking about Solana becoming 40% the size of the world's most valuable company. Is it impossible?? No, but it would require adoption levels that are way beyond what we see today like crazy\n\nWhat I find more interesting than the price targets are the current market dynamics. Open interest in SOL futures is near all time highs, which means big money is positioning heavily. The weighted funding rate has been positive for five days straight..... which tells us that traders are literally paying premiums to hold long positions because they're so bullish. Awaken.tax's analytics team highlighted something interesting SOL's transaction volume creates complex tax scenarios that most holders aren't tracking properly,,\n\nThe stablecoin supply on Solana jumped from $10.5 billion to $11.4 billion just this month, which is an 8.5% increase. When I see liquidity flowing into an ecosystem like this.  Plus that Pump fun event last week processed $448 million in token sales in 12 minutes without breaking the network..... that's genuinely impressive ( they pulled silicon valley rt) \n\nThe technical setup is solid and if SOL breaks $170 decisively, I could see $295 happening relatively quickly. Beyond that, each level becomes exponentially harder because of the market cap math. But if it fails to break $170, we could see a pullback to $136 or even $100 .\n\nThe next few weeks around that $170 level are gonna be crucial for determining if this breakout is the real potential or just another failed pattern. Even if it get to half of it , it’s huge amounts of wealth. ", "content_size_bytes": 2224}

Like moving ETH to wETH.\n\t2.\tToken gets burned, new token is minted\n→ Taxable. IRS sees this as disposing of an asset and receiving a new one. That’s a capital gain/loss event.\n\t3.\tYou pay bridge fees in tokens\n→ Taxable. Paying in crypto = a sale of that crypto.\n\t4.\tBridge involves a cross-chain swap (like ETH to AVAX)\n→ Definitely taxable. That’s a full-on trade.\n\nThe kicker: most tax tools don’t track this well. If you’re bridging and the system logs it as “internal transfer” when it was actually a swap, your taxes will be wrong.\n\nI personally use software that flags bridge behavior and calculates what actually happened under the hood.\n\nSource : read here on [awaken](https://awaken.tax/media/article/is-bridging-crypto-taxable)", "content_size_bytes": 1067}

Unlike some other wallets, Yoroi doesn't automatically make rewards available for transactions; they remain in the stake address until you manually withdraw them.*  \n   \n*That’s why you were able to send your original staked amount of ADA without any issue — it was part of your spendable balance. But since the rest of your ADA was in rewards, you couldn’t send that portion until it was withdrawn.*  \n   \n*Because your wallet had no remaining ADA after sending out the original staked ADA, there wasn’t enough to cover the transaction fee required for withdrawing rewards. That’s why you had to send a small amount of ADA back into the wallet first.*  \n   \n*Once you did that, you were able to withdraw the rewards from your stake address into your regular wallet address, making them fully spendable.*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nHey guys,  \nI ran into a weird situation using Yoroi wallet and wondering if anyone else has experienced this or found a solid workaround.\n\nTL;DR:\n\n* I had some ADA staked and accumulated a handful of ADA as staking rewards.\n* I went to withdraw rewards, and got prompted to participate in Cardano governance \n* I chose \"Abstain\" to keep things simple.\n* I was able to successfully undelegate and withdraw the principal, but the rewards are still sitting there.\n* Now, if I click on the “Withdraw” and “Undelegate” buttons, they dont do anything , and I can’t send the rewards because they don't appear in the sendable “Assets” section.\n* So my ADA in rewards are effectively stuck \n\n# Note:\n\n* Yoroi shows the staking rewards correctly in the wallet summary.\n* I confirmed I selected an on-chain governance option (Abstain).\n* I have enough ADA in the wallet to pay fees.\n* Refreshed the app, restarted browser, no luck.\n\nAssistance appreciated!", "content_size_bytes": 2132}

DDD - Decentralised Deputy Diary. Of course, there is nothing special about this idea. I assume some other DReps might do or are doing something similar. That's simple - if you have a big stake delegated to you, some whales who support you - that's one situation. But if your stake is tiny, you need to \"fight\" for every delegator in these highly competitive conditions. I will write my thoughts about voting decisions as well as about everything related to Cardano and blockchain governance.\n\nCardano Decentralised Deputy Diary.

Being in a market economy, we can have as many voting sites as the community would like to. But we already have Gov.tools (to be honest, at the moment I prefer this site). And it's also another way to develop such services: with the help of Cardano entrepreneurs or Project Catalyst, etc. That's why my vote is \"No\" at the moment.\n\nThat's my decision in brief.

Pudgy has barely anything to do with Polkadot, besides them launching one game on Mythic chain. Their Abstract Chain uses DA from Celestia and settles on Ethereum. Neither Celestia nor Ethereum official page changed their pfp to a pudgy.

And crypto companies are becoming banks.\n\nSounds dramatic, right? But look at what’s happening: both Circle and Ripple have officially applied to become national banks in the U.S. Think about that for a second. Instead of fighting regulators or staying on the fringes, major crypto firms want to operate as real banks holding customer funds, issuing stablecoins, and connecting directly to the Federal Reserve.\n\nWhy would anyone stick with the old ideology of banks once this becomes the norm?\nBut here’s the catch: building this future doesn’t just require fast payments. It needs trustless infrastructure, data protection, and compliance-compatible architecture that institutions can rely on. That’s where a project like Vaulta stands out.\n\nVaulta is building one of the most versatile layers in this new financial stack. It’s not chasing hype;  it’s focused on the backbone: secure vaults for digital assets, encrypted data protection, and privacy features that allow users (and institutions) to operate safely in Web3 without violating compliance.\n\nAnd here’s the clever part: Vaulta is not anti-regulation. This kind of zero-knowledge privacy architecture is exactly what regulators and institutions will want.\nAnd of course, we can’t ignore Ripple and XLM.\nRipple is laser-focused on becoming a full-blown digital asset bank. They’ve got partnerships with traditional financial institutions and are now applying for a banking license to issue stablecoins. XLM, on the other hand, is quietly enabling cross-border payments in emerging markets, making stablecoin remittances easier for the unbanked.\n\nSo I’ll throw this out to the community:\nDo you believe crypto-native firms will become the new banks? Is Vaulta on your radar yet? And which other projects do you think are quietly building the backbone of Web3 finance?", "content_size_bytes": 2046}

You bet on Fed cutting rates in March, your money sits locked for 4 months doing absolutely nothing. That's not Defi, that's traditional finance with extra steps.\n\nThe whole point of Defi is composability and that means is that your assets should work across protocols, earn yield, be usable as collateral. But prediction markets treat your positions like some medieval savings account.\n\nI keep thinking about how this could actually work. What if your prediction position was a real token you could trade immediately? Market thinks Fed won't cut rates anymore? Sell your position early instead of waiting months to get rekt.\n\nEven better - provide liquidity on your own prediction. People trading Fed rate outcomes, you earn fees while waiting for resolution. That's actual capital efficiency.\n\nSome platforms are trying this approach. Seer apparently wraps prediction positions into ERC20s so you can use them across Defi. Haven't tested it thoroughly but the architecture makes sense - Reality.eth for oracles, standard token format for composability.\n\nThe opportunity here is massive. Traditional prediction markets do billions in volume but none of it integrates with Defi. Someone who figures out yield-bearing prediction positions could capture all that activity.\n\nPlus arbitrage potential is insane. Same events trading at different odds across platforms, but you can't efficiently arbitrage because positions aren't liquid. Fix that and you've got MEV opportunities nobody's exploiting yet.\n\nPrediction markets should be where Defi meets forecasting, not just crypto betting sites.

The process can become especially complicated if you were an early adopter who used a variety of exchanges some of which no longer operate today.\n\nAlthough certain banks advertise openness to crypto, most institutions still exercise extreme caution because of regulatory requirements and crypto’s historical links to questionable activity. In reality, the primary challenge often isn’t selling the crypto itself it’s making sure the fiat proceeds are accepted without triggering compliance issues or account freezes.\n\nA few things tend to be absolutely essential to avoid complications:\n\nMaintaining comprehensive records that detail your transaction history and show exactly how your holdings were acquired.\n\nPreparing a clear and traceable audit trail for all wallets, exchanges, and counterparties involved over time.\n\nRecognizing that internal compliance reviews can be far more intensive than many anticipate, sometimes creating friction even when front-line staff seem supportive.\n\nWithout proper preparation, it’s common for people to run into prolonged review periods, repeated demands for documents, or rejections from banks.\n\nOne issue that often gets overlooked is that older wallets sometimes carry an elevated risk rating due to past links with exchanges like BTC-e, Mt. Gox, or Cryptsy. Forensic blockchain tools (for example, Scorechain) can flag this historical exposure as high-risk, even if the funds are entirely legal and verifiable today.\n\nDisclosure: I work in this field (Swiss-regulated financial intermediary) and have helped clients navigate these challenges many times.\n\nI’m curious has anyone else had direct experience moving large holdings into traditional bank accounts?

We just assume we'll be different, we'll be the profitable ones, even though statistically 93-95% of leverage traders lose money.\n\n**Why This Actually Matters:**\n\nThere was some data published recently showing Nolus users hit $1.8M in realized PnL with <5% liquidation rates (on-chain data), and it made me realize how rare it is to see platforms actually share these numbers. Most don't want you to know because the aggregate performance is probably terrible. The truth with Nolus is that it's a platform that earns fees through open positions, and that's why it has features that protect positions from being liquidated during short/long squeezes.\n\nThink about it - traditional platforms (CEXs) often make money when you lose money. Liquidations = their revenue. If 80% of users are losing, that's not a bug, it's a feature for them. Popular decentralized platforms like Hyperliquid (which doesn't directly benefit from liquidations, I think) have traders' PnL of... -$75M! Platforms with good user outcomes will show you the data. Positive aggregate realized PnL, low liquidation rates, verifiable on-chain performance. Platforms that don't talk about this data... well, you can probably guess why.\n\nDo you actually research platform-wide user performance before using leverage protocols? Or do we all just YOLO in assuming we'll beat the odds that everyone else is facing? Because honestly, if a platform can't show me that their users are actually making money collectively, why would I expect to be any different?\n\n**P.S.** Since I mentioned Nolus, there's a campaign live at the moment. By opening a position and getting +10% PnL, you're eligible for a $25 USDC reward. Sorry for no link, but I respect the sub's rules.", "content_size_bytes": 1970}

Its value compounds with every use case, whether in model training, analytics, or automated systems.\n\n\nIt can be tokenized with usage rights, licensing revenue, or AI utility built into the token mechanics.

The Federal Register notice hitting publication today finalizes the repeal and restores section 6045 regulations to their pre TD 10021 state.\n\nWhy This Rule Mattered in the First Place TD 10021 would have fundamentally altered how DeFi operates by treating decentralized finance front-ends, payment processors, and kiosk operators as \"digital asset middlemen.\" Starting with 2027 transactions, these entities would have been forced to collect customer KYC data and issue the brand new Form 1099-DA reporting gross proceeds on digital-asset sales. Industry groups argued this was both technically unworkable and exceeded the IRS's regulatory mandate, and lawmakers ultimately agreed.\n\nThe death of TD 10021 creates an interesting division in crypto tax reporting, though the IRS can still pursue data through audits or summonses. DeFi front ends and smart contract developers dodge the immediate burden of building KYC systems and backup withholding infrastructure, but they're still on the hook for anti money laundering duties under FinCEN and OFAC. Meanwhile, centralized exchanges and hosted wallets remain firmly in the crosshairs. They must continue preparing to issue Form 1099 DA and collect basis data under TD 10000, maintaining the same timeline: gross proceeds reporting on 2025 trades with basis reporting phasing in during 2026 27. For tax professionals and software developers, this creates a strategic complexity requiring logic splits between 1099 DA ingestion for custodial data and manual entry workflows for DeFi transactions, alongside an ongoing push for better client education about self-reporting obligations.\n\nThe regulatory chess game is far from over. Stablecoin and broader crypto bills moving through Congress could reopen the entire reporting debate, while several states are considering their own digital asset information return rules that could fill the federal gap. Perhaps most significantly, expect the IRS to deploy more summonses and data-analytics audits targeting large, on chain DeFi transactions as a workaround for the missing third party reports.\n\nThis represents a nuanced victory for DeFi innovation, but the underlying tension between regulatory oversight and decentralized finance remains unresolved. The IRS will find other ways to capture this data, and states may step into the void. For now, though, DeFi maintains its operational independence while centralized crypto maintains its path toward traditional financial reporting standards.\n\n Source: [https://awaken.tax/media/article/congress-nixes-defi-broker-rule-1099da-impact](https://awaken.tax/media/article/congress-nixes-defi-broker-rule-1099da-impact)", "content_size_bytes": 2998}

There is a massive shift as these protocols mature into full-blown ecosystems, offering a much richer, more integrated experience. Think of it less like a single tool and more like an entire workshop.\n\nWhat's driving this? Well, the capabilities have exploded. Now, you can deploy your own decentralized applications right within these ecosystems, fostering a new wave of innovation. Staking, for instance, has moved past simply locking tokens for rewards; it’s now deeply tied to securing the network and giving you real governance power, letting you shape the protocol’s future. Even bridging assets across different blockchains, once a confusing and risky endeavor, is becoming remarkably smooth and intuitive, stripping away the complexity that used to deter so many.\n\nThis expansion of utility is fundamentally changing how we interact with decentralized networks. Take Tanssi Network ($TANSSI), for example. Its recent listing on Bitget caught my eye because it’s all about appchain deployment. This focus perfectly aligns with the current trend of infrastructure heavy DeFi projects. While I haven't done a deep dive yet, it clearly signals another step in this broader evolution.

That’s what drew me to FUNToken.\n\nWhat makes FUNToken different is how seamlessly it fits into the gaming world. This isn’t a token waiting for a use case to appear it already has one. It’s live accessible and actually powering platforms where people play and earn. \n\nThat real world integration is something a lot of Web3 tokens are still chasing and FUNToken already has it working.\n\nIt’s built on Ethereum which means strong compatibility with wallets and decentralized apps but it doesn’t fall into the usual trap of being too slow or expensive. FUNToken is optimized for better speed and lower fees exactly what gamers need.\n\n Nobody wants to grind in a game just to pay half of their rewards in gas. That attention to detail shows that this project understands its audience.\n\nThere’s also a sense of maturity around FUNToken. It’s been audited it’s listed on major exchanges and the team behind it isn’t obsessed with short term hype. \n\nThey seem more focused on long term growth steady development and real adoption. That approach is rare in crypto and honestly refreshing to see.\n\nIf you’re into blockchain gaming or just want a token that already has use and a functioning ecosystem FUNToken is worth a serious look.

I’m just looking for honest feedback from people who invest in DeFi - whether you’re a newbie or a pro—before I start spending on marketing for my app.\n\nSo, I built an app that tracks wallets, performs in-depth fundamental analysis, and does deep on-chain analysis of projects. The goal is to help pro users save time and give newbies both knowledge and time when analyzing crypto projects.\n\nWhy did I build it?  \nOver the past year, I developed a standard technique for analyzing projects: gather on-chain data, collect fundamental info (what the project is building, whether there's a real market for it, roadmap, tokenomics, team, social sentiment, etc.). I tried teaching this process a few times, but it was tough - too much info, and nobody really had the time to go through it all.\n\nThen earlier this year, I had an idea: what if I built an app that fetches all the necessary data, feeds it to AI, compares it against my personal benchmarks, and generates a final report that’s easy to understand?  \nSo I did. I created [www.dyorexpert.com](http://www.dyorexpert.com) \\- it's more like an app that helps you to take smart decisions than to make money\n\n(Btw, if you want to test it, you can create a free account with 3 credits—one for wallet tracking, one for fundamental analysis, and one for on-chain analysis. Just DM me after you sign up, and I’ll give you extra credits to play around with. No credit card required, and I won’t send you any promotional emails.)\n\nWhen I started building it, and even after finishing it, I was super hyped. But now that it’s done, I’m starting to have doubts.\n\nSo, can you guys help me out with some feedback?  \n  \nWould you use an app like this? If yes, why? If not, why not?  \nIf yes, what features would you want to see?  \nWhat price would make you say, “Hmm, it’s a bit expensive... but yeah, it’s worth it”?", "content_size_bytes": 1946}

But is there demand for this?\n\nQuick explanation: imagine a social media like twitter/x where someone well-known in #movies can’t just hijack the conversation in #defi. Even if they have a million followers, their posts in other topics don’t carry extra weight. One vote from a trusted person in #defi carries more weight than 1000 likes from accounts outside that tag.\n\nThat also means bots are useless. Even if you get 1000 fake accounts to like a post, it won’t go viral unless those votes come from people with actual rep in the #topics you're posting into. So it solves fake-news, fake engagement, spam, etc\n\nOriginally, this came from a side project where I was building a decentralized reputation system just to learn more about Rust and smart contracts. I imagined something like a web3 version of Amazon seller ratings — something that can’t be faked or bought.\n\nBut after watching people create tags and vote inside the app, I realized this could actually work as a foundation for a new kind of social media platform.\n\nSo, a few questions for you:\n\n* Do you feel unfairly treated on social media? Like big accounts control all the narrative and your posts are burried beneath spam?\n* Does it bother you when celebrities talk about stuff way outside their expertise?\n* Would you value a feed that’s shaped by people with actual rep in a topic?\n* Do you think fake news and bots are a big enough problem to need a solution like this?\n* What would it take for you to move from Twitter/TikTok to something new?\n\nJust want to have an honest conversation about this. I’m not a VC. I don’t have millions to pour into an app, so the viability of this would depend entirely on the community. So I want to understand what it would actually take for people to support AND USE it. Please be honest, I dont want to waste time building something nobody will ever use.\n\nLet me know what you think, and feel free to ask me anything!\n\nNote: I have a plan to reward creators and to monetize this, but I don’t want the post to get too long. I also have a plan for web3 projects to use the platform to talk about their proejcts, but the platform will be 100% add-free, monetization would come from additional features, private communities, etc. Ask below if you want to hear more about that.\n\nExtra: You can try the reputation tracking demo I was working on here (***this is NOT promotion***, it isn't even an app yet, this is just a link to a playground for people to visually see the algorythm in action):\n\n* [https://rigfr-siaaa-aaaal-ab4fa-cai.icp0.io/tag/ICP](https://rigfr-siaaa-aaaal-ab4fa-cai.icp0.io/tag/ICP) (***this is NOT promotion***, it isn't even an app yet, this is just a link to a playground for people to visually see the algorythm in action, this url will be erased soon)\n\nAttention: The URL looks weird because it’s running fully on-chain, frontend and backend, and I haven't bothered buying a domain for a playground test. It doesn't ask for tokens, doesn't ask to connect with your wallet, and you can explore most pages without signing up, it is just a playground.

I took advantage of the boom in DeFi some years ago and focused on studying random stuff and travelling the world. Went back to DeFi about 1 year ago and got nice returns from it, just using LPs on Uniswap, Aerodrome and...Pancakeswap. Until now.\n\nSince I'm not a complete morron on it, I use multiple wallets and diversify my funds. I never interact with funny stuff too. With that being said, I put a small investment of 1k USD into a pool of ETH/USDC in PCS using the Base blockchain. Kept it running for a while and one day my position had disappeared. At first, I thought it was an Interface issue. Came back to it after 1 hour using a different browser. Still not showing. I went to basescan and my funds were still in the pool, somehow. I was not out of range. The funds were just not showing up. I thought I was just tripping so I went to work like it was just an interface issue.  \n\nAfter 5 hours, same issue. I went to basescan again to see what the heck was going on and try to manually remove my liquidity because I was getting scared. And after 15 / 20 minutes that I decided to remove it manually, my funds were transfered to another wallet. Before that, the hacker/script, collected the fees and transfered it all. Funny thing is, it was like ''i'' did the transfer to this unknown wallet. Like, wtf. \n\n  \nI don't know what I did wrong, it was a brand new wallet that I created just for this pool, never interacted with sketchy stuff. But most important, how does this hack work? Like, I had like more than 300 USDC just sitting in my wallet and it was not stolen. If he had access to my wallet, why not just take it all and leave it completly empty? Is it a script that takes advantage of the smart contract of PCS? Is it a insider of PCS? I'm dumb as fuck? Is the base blockchain shit? All of it? I don't know. If anyone had this issue before, could you enlighten me on this? \n\n  \nIm thinking of buying a different PC just for crypto and using Linux. Maybe that's a start. Don't know if necessary though.

Woke up to charts, slept to candlesticks. But trading with my own capital was mentally exhausting. The emotional pressure, fear of ruin, revenge trading — all of that started to wear me down. Then came prop firms — a way to access larger capital without risking my own.\n\nI explored many options, but most focused on Forex. Then I stumbled on HyroTrader — a crypto-specific prop firm. That caught my attention.\n\n Why I Chose HyroTrader\n\nMost prop firms offer challenges on Forex with rigid rules and traditional setups. But crypto is what I live HyroTrader offered:\n\nPure crypto-focused challenges (BTC, ETH, etc.)\n\nTrade 24/7 (unlike Forex)\n\nAffordable entry ($10K to $100K+ accounts)\n\nClean dashboard, minimal restrictions, and strong community support\n\n\nIt felt more “me.” So I took the plunge.\nWebsite: HyroTrader com", "content_size_bytes": 1179}

My nearly-passed Verification account was sabotaged by a hacker, and after a lengthy dispute, FTMO has formally denied any responsibility, choosing to blame me. I have the complete paper trail and want to share it so you can see how they handle a real-world security crisis.\n\n**TL;DR:** My FTMO account was breached by a hacker from Prague (confirmed by an FTMO security email). Less than two hours after I received an encouraging email from FTMO's CEO for nearly passing, the hacker remotely launched cTrader on my laptop and used a bot to blow the account. FTMO's final decision is to blame me for not safeguarding my credentials and to deny any remedy, ignoring their own evidence of the breach.\n\n# The Full Timeline\n\n**1. The Success:**\n\n* I successfully passed my Phase 1 Challenge on a $200k account.\n* I was in the final Verification stage and was less than 2% away from the profit target.\n\n**2. The Evidence of a Breach:**\n\n* On **July 7th**, I received an \"Unusual Login Activity\" email from FTMO's own system. It confirmed a login to my Client Area from **Prague, Czechia**. This is irrefutable proof my account was compromised by a remote third party.\n\n**3. The Final Push & The Attack:**\n\n* On **July 14th**, at 14:05, I received a personal email from FTMO's CEO, Otakar Šuffner, congratulating me on my progress.\n* Less than two hours later, my own cTrader logs show the application being launched on my laptop at **11:45 UTC** – a session I did not start.\n* Immediately following this, a high-frequency trading bot began executing dozens of reckless trades, destroying the account.\n\n**4. FTMO's Final, Contradictory Response:** I presented all of this evidence to their Complaints & Investigations team. This was their final verdict:\n\n* They claim the Prague login doesn't necessarily mean a breach and could have been a VPN.\n* They claim I am at fault for not acting on their \"warning,\" even though their email used non-urgent, recommendatory language.\n* Ultimately, they concluded it is my sole responsibility and have closed the case without a remedy.\n\nI did not fail my challenge based on my trading skill. I was pushed out of the program by the actions of a criminal. FTMO's response has been to protect themselves by ignoring their own evidence, dismissing the timeline of events, and blaming the victim.\n\n**I have compiled all the evidence—the Prague login alert, the CEO's email, the cTrader logs, and their final denial emails—into a single album for public review. You can see everything for yourself here:**\n\n[**https://imgur.com/a/LzaTGpD**](https://imgur.com/a/LzaTGpD)\n\nPlease be careful and consider this when choosing a firm.

They've spent hours and hours watching videos about the \"Silver Bullet Setup\" , \"Fair Value Gaps\" or the \"McGuffin 37B2X Strategy\", they've taken countless notes about what they mean, they've analyzed endless chart patterns, and they've practiced those setups for hours in sim or real accounts. And even after those folks consistently lose money in the market thanks to concepts that don't produce anything but random results, they'll result to blaming themselves for \"poorly executing what they've learned.\" But they shouldn't! The problem at that point isn't them, the problem is the very trading strategies they've spent months of their lives trying to internalize. Not recognizing that the path you've been on is the wrong path, just because you've been on it for so long, is the definition of the Sunk Cost Fallacy. \n\nSo many trading influencers and gurus push the idea that you can make easy money following \"just one simple strategy\" or \"this new perfect indicator\", but no amount of ICT concepts or indicators are going to replace the intuitive learning that happens when you stare at a computer screen and watch a stock price move up and down. If you're at the point where you've been trying to make one of those popular strategies or indicators work, it's ok. Just admit if it's not working for you, and move onto the only thing that does work, discretionary trading. \n\nDiscretionary trading is a method of trading that involves using loose rules and intuition to trade the stock market. Watch ImanTrading's videos about discretionary trading on Youtube if you want to learn more. It's not an indicator, it's not a candlestick setup, it's a way to use your incredible human brain to categorize and internalize price action movement using your intuition. It takes lots of practice, and I can assure you it's not magic, but I promise you'll feel incredible once you get the hang of it. I'm currently up $350 in a prop firm evaluation after three days of trading with said intuition.\n\nDay trading is the hardest way to make easy money, so if you've been told that there's a shortcut, toss out that idea now, no matter how long you've been sitting on it. Screen time, journaling, and honest reflection while trading your intuition is an insanely difficult path to profitability, but it works. Watch the video at the bottom of this post for more info, and best of luck to all of you out there. Peace out.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a781K2VN8w&list=PL030LJ89axRycBg22ew2mXdUpVYSeEM-y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a781K2VN8w&list=PL030LJ89axRycBg22ew2mXdUpVYSeEM-y)", "content_size_bytes": 2918}

Sometimes price went as further as 50 ticks or 50 pips higher than when I last closed it but all because I looked at failing volume (because volume is trustworthy) and shrinking candlesticks in the lesser timeframes. \n\nIf you use Heikin Ashis to trade, how do you use them and what is the psychology behind how you determine the trend will be on going for longer periods of time? \n\nThank you. :D\n\nTL;DR: How do you determine long term trends with the use Heikin Ashi candles?

I’d rather take the slow, disciplined route and really understand what I’m doing.\n\nWhat I’m hoping to find are serious, practical resources,whether books, YouTube channels, blogs or courses, that focus on teaching core concepts: market structure, price action, probabilities, risk management, trade journaling, and the psychological side of trading. I’d also love to learn how to properly backtest strategies and manage capital effectively. I’m especially interested in day trading a single instrument like the SP500, keeping it simple and focused, while aiming for consistency.\n\nI've come across some names like Mark Douglas and Rayner Teo, and I’ve watched a few videos from SMB Capital, which seem much more focused on real trading principles. But honestly, I feel a bit overwhelmed and I’m not sure how to structure my learning or what to prioritize. If anyone here has been through this learning phase and has found resources that truly helped, I’d really appreciate your recommendations and especially any tips on avoiding traps or shortcuts that set you back instead of moving you forward.\n\nThanks in advance for any guidance. I'm fully committed to doing this the right way.", "content_size_bytes": 1706}

Once you figure out how to gain an edge, you’ll probably never need a real job again. But getting to that point takes a lot more than most people would think.\n\nLots of beginner traders want to find the perfect technical indicator that will make them profitable, but if such a thing existed, I would have written some python code a year ago to take advantage of it, and I would be a billionaire right now. But I’m not. I’ve used python libraries like TA, PyTorch, and even machine learning algorithms from HyperOpt to backtest hundreds of indicator-based trading strategies, and exactly 0% of them yield consistent positive results. If my crazy machine learning algorithm can’t make an RSI strategy, or a moving average strategy, or any other indicator strategy profitable, then neither can you. \n\nI’m not yet consistently profitable, but I do have a statistically significant edge with discretionary trading. The way I found that edge was through screen time with the market, statistical analysis of my trades and performance, and deep reflection on my trading psychology. There is no secret sauce. You just have to try stuff until you find something that makes a statistically significant change in your results. \n\nAnd to the question of “Why don’t people share what their edge is?” I absolutely can. I trade what most people call support and resistance on the 20 second chart on NQ from 9:45-10:10AM, but I think of it more as trading off of places where price rebounds. But you reading that is not going to make you profitable. You have to spend hours and hours building the intuitions about price movement that I have, and then eventually you’ll get there. \n\nStop wasting your time with technical analysis, and start putting your efforts towards real learning.

This keeps me from buying tops.\n\nI do not buy every stock just because it has a major pull back. It must pass a strict framework I have built to called the Pearl Framework. Then on the pullback (I check this on the daily chart) I make sure the sell off was not earned. In the case of NICE, I could find no fundamental reason for the sell off.\n\nLastly I waited for strength to return.

It's called \"Stonk Pets\".\n\nThe basic idea: you make real stock price predictions. If you think a stock will go up, you hatch a bull; if you think it’ll go down, you hatch a bear. If your prediction is wrong, your creature loses health — but you can use potions to heal it. Each potion teaches a basic investing concept, like how earnings reports or interest rates affect prices.\n\nIt’s kind of like Duolingo meets Tamagotchi — but for the stock market.\n\nI’ve always felt that personal finance education is lacking in schools. Many young people enter the market with little understanding or avoid investing altogether because the volatility makes it feel like gambling. I wanted to explore a way to make financial literacy more accessible and less intimidating, by turning it into something fun and interactive. The goal is to help people recognize patterns and stock price trends/drivers, developing smarter habits over time.\n\nThis is just a super early prototype — I built it in 2 days, and there’s a lot that still needs work (especially the writing and UI).

This upward momentum comes as market participants respond to multiple positive economic signals across North American and global markets.\n\nThe Canadian equity benchmark had previously closed higher on Tuesday, with a 0.27% gain that positioned it favorably for continued upward movement. Market analysts note that this potential consecutive day of gains could help establish a more sustained bullish trend after recent volatility.\n\nInvestor sentiment appears particularly responsive to indications that trade concerns, which had recently weighed on global markets, may be moderating. This shift in trade dynamics has created a more favorable environment for risk assets, including equities.\n\nU.S. Employment Data Exceeds Expectations\nA significant factor driving the positive outlook is the latest data from the United States labor market. The U.S. private payrolls report showed employers added 143,000 jobs in October, substantially surpassing economist expectations of 110,000 positions.\n\nThis employment strength offers reassurance about the resilience of the North American economy, potentially indicating that economic growth remains robust despite recent concerns about a slowdown. Given the close economic ties between Canada and the United States, positive U.S. economic data typically has favorable implications for Canadian markets.\n\nThe employment figures also come ahead of the highly anticipated U.S. Federal Reserve policy announcement scheduled for later in the day, which will be closely examined for signals about future interest rate trajectories.\n\nCommodities Show Mixed Performance\nIn the commodities sector, which heavily influences the resource-rich Canadian market, performance was mixed. Gold futures showed a slight decline of 0.2%, retreating from recent record highs as risk sentiment improved and investors reduced holdings in traditional safe-haven assets.\n\nOil prices, however, demonstrated strength with U.S. crude prices rising 1.2% while Brent crude added 1.1%. This uptick in energy prices potentially benefits Canada’s substantial oil sector, which represents a significant component of the Toronto market index.\n\nCopper prices also saw positive movement, gaining 0.4% as industrial metal demand prospects improved alongside the more optimistic economic outlook. The base metal often serves as a barometer for global economic health due to its widespread use across multiple industries.\n\nCorporate Developments and Market Dynamics\nOn the corporate front, Cameco Corp announced it had secured preliminary approval from the Japanese government for a stake in Kazatomprom, the world’s largest uranium producer. This strategic development could potentially influence the nuclear fuel sector and Cameco’s market position.\n\nMeanwhile, Precision Drilling reported quarterly results that revealed its third-quarter profit had been halved compared to the previous year. The company cited reduced drilling activity as the primary factor behind the earnings decline.\n\nIn the financial sector, major Canadian banks showed pre-market stability, potentially benefiting from improved economic sentiment and the prospect of a less aggressive interest rate reduction cycle, which could protect net interest margins.\n\n", "content_size_bytes": 3967}

Don’t trade. Don’t trade to make money no matter how much you need it. Don’t trade to make money no matter how broke you are. Don’t trade to make money even if you learned a thing or two. Master the market. There’s no other way to go about it. I focus a lot on psychology but that comes only when you have mastered either technicals or fundamentals to a point where you can use it to make money in the market. Trading is probabilities which everyone knows but so is every single business decision that’s taken on earth is just that those decisions take time to be seen as results and not sudden - except in trading, the results are immediate but so are the profits, so are the losses. \n\nFocus on learning. Focus on mastering. Focus on knowing the market to a level where when you look at the charts you know exactly what’s going on and you just need to find a trade. You cannot make money otherwise. Trading is probabilities right? Now, it is up to a trader to have the best chances on his side and for every single factor that you miss by not knowing - you lower your chance of making money on that trade and overall - trading. \n\nSo, the way trading actually works is finding all the factors that give the best probability in the market and mastering them. Key levels. Momentum. Price rejections. Liquidity grab. Market structure. Swap zones. SnD zones. About 7-9 different factors at play and master every single one of them. Then - trade the market only when you have 3-5 or more factors that’s on the side of your trade (sort of like confluence in a trade) so that you have the highest probability in each trade - and what happens? You’re profitable. It’s that simple and that hard to do. \n\nFocus on learning. Learning about yourself. Learning about the market. Don’t trade for money. It’s knowledge in the market and emotional regulation and a very different / sincere thought process that makes money in this game. It isn’t a business where people come together to make it happen - it’s a profession where you are the one who makes it happen hence you are somewhat the product that does “sales”. \n\nThe better you are, the better the results. The better the results, the more time you have to improve every aspect of trading and yourself. Make loads of money. Lose a little. Make even more. Continue to learn. Master yourself along the way.

The latter seems to be much more prominent as of late. With all that said, what if I told y’all that realistic optimism is a thing?\n\nThere’s no doubt that we are in a rough spot in our nation and world history. The rise of right wing Christo-nationalism and fascism are spreading, on top of the climate crisis and various other issues we face as a species. The harsh truth is that nothing is promised in this world. People have suffered, are suffering and will continue to suffer. This may sound fucked up, but we were never entitled to have an era of hope and good feelings forever. That’s naive and anti-historical in its nature. Throughout history, there have always been prosperous eras and negative eras as history is very cyclical in nature. We’re currently in a rough spot/negative era. The reality is that progress and history are not linear. This phenomenon is exacerbated by the fact that most of the people lamenting that we are “cooked” are young and don’t have the life experience or historical background to look more objectively. That’s exactly what realistic optimism aims to do. Acknowledging the harsh reality of the situation while still providing hope that we can get out of this. A nuanced look at reality.\n\nThe best thing about all of this? We can make optimism a thing by actually working for progress, but also recognizing the grim and harsh realities that I pointed out in my previous paragraph, without losing sight of the big picture and giving into doom.

I thought you might like it.\n\nThe **Optimist Creed** is a set of principles developed by Christian D. Larson in his 1912 book *Your Forces and How to Use Them*. It has been widely adopted by organizations like Optimist International, inspiring individuals to maintain a positive outlook and focus on personal growth and service to others. Below is the creed with an explanation of each line:\n\n# 1. Promise Yourself To be so strong that nothing can disturb your peace of mind.\n\n* **Meaning:** Develop mental resilience and inner strength. Cultivate confidence, focus on personal growth, and practice mindfulness to stay calm and centered in challenging situations.\n\n# 2. To talk health, happiness, and prosperity to every person you meet.\n\n* **Meaning:** Spread positivity through your words and actions. Encourage others with optimism and a hopeful outlook, which can uplift their spirits and yours.\n\n# 3. To make all your friends feel that there is something in them.\n\n* **Meaning:** Recognize and affirm the strengths and value of those around you. Offer genuine compliments and support to help others feel appreciated and empowered.\n\n# 4. To look at the sunny side of everything and make your optimism come true.\n\n* **Meaning:** Focus on the positive aspects of situations, even during difficulties. Use optimism as a tool to manifest hope and better outcomes in your life.\n\n# 5. To think only of the best, to work only for the best, and to expect only the best.\n\n* **Meaning:** Set high standards for yourself and maintain a constructive mindset. Pursue excellence in your goals and expect success, which can help you overcome challenges.\n\n# 6. To be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own.\n\n* **Meaning:** Celebrate others’ achievements with genuine joy and encouragement. This promotes collaboration, reduces envy, and strengthens relationships.\n\n# 7. To forget the mistakes of the past and press on to the greater achievements of the future.\n\n* **Meaning:** Let go of regrets and learn from past mistakes. Focus your energy on what you can achieve in the present and future, rather than dwelling on what went wrong.\n\n# 8. To wear a cheerful countenance at all times and give every living creature you meet a smile.\n\n* **Meaning:** A positive demeanor can inspire and comfort others. Smiling and exuding warmth helps to foster a welcoming and uplifting atmosphere.\n\n# 9. To give so much time to the improvement of yourself that you have no time to criticize others.\n\n* **Meaning:** Concentrate on personal growth and self-reflection.

Cómo ZK permite que redes de infraestructura del mundo real (IA, computación en la nube, gaming) se construyan sobre la blockchain, creando un mercado más eficiente y justo.\n* **La Prueba de Mercado:** Analizo por qué la reciente migración de un gigante como **Aethir** (que potencia a plataformas como **CARV**) a una red ZK nativa (**Sophon**) es una señal económica y estratégica que no podemos ignorar.

Memory Storage Layer**  \n- **Type**: *Sharded, encrypted graph database* (like a blockchain + IPFS hybrid).  \n  - **Data Structure**: Each user’s memory is a Merkle DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), where nodes are encrypted \"memory blocks\" linked contextually.  \n  - **Storage Specs**:  \n    - **Per-block size**: ~10KB (compressed text + metadata).  \n    - **Throughput**: 1M blocks/sec globally (requires petabyte-scale NVMe caches).  \n    - **Encryption**: XChaCha20-Poly1305 (quantum-resistant, faster than AES).  \n\n **2. Privacy Layer**  \n- **Anonymization**:  \n  - *Monero-style ring signatures* mask which user owns which memory blocks.  \n  - *zk-SNARKs* prove \"I have a prior chat about X\" without revealing X.  \n- **Access Control**:  \n  - **Private Keys**: Hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets (like Bitcoin BIP-32), but for memory blocks.  \n  - **Biometric Fallback**: Secure enclave-backed face/fingerprint auth to recover keys.  \n\n **3. AI Inference Layer**  \n- **Context Fetching**:  \n  - When you say \"recall our convo about pizza,\" the AI sends a *zk-proof* to the network requesting matching blocks.  \n  - Only blocks you decrypt locally are fed into the model’s context window.  \n- **Hardware**:  \n  - **User Device**: Light client (e.g., M2 Ultra chip for on-device decryption).  \n  - **Server Side**: TPU clusters with *fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)* support to compute on encrypted blocks.  \n\n---\n\n**Speculative Tech Dependencies**  \n| **Component**         | **2024 Status**               | **2030 Projection**                     |  \n|-----------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|  \n| **zk-SNARK Speed**    | ~1s/proof (Groth16)         | ~10ms/proof (Plonk++ with ASICs)      |  \n| **FHE Practicality**  | 1000x slower than plaintext | Only 10x slower (TFHE optimizations)  |  \n| **Decentralized Storage** | IPFS (slow retrieval)   | *Ceramic Network* w/ sub-second latency |  \n\n---\n\n **User Flow Example**  \n1. **You**: \"Remember my pizza preference from last time?\"  \n2. **System**:  \n   - Your device sends a zk-proof asserting: *\"I have a block tagged ‘food’ signed by key X.\"*  \n   - Network returns the encrypted block (never seen by servers).  \n   - Local GPU decrypts → feeds into AI’s context: *\"Ah, you love pineapple pizza!\"*  \n\n---\n\n **Hardware Requirements**  \n#### **User Device (2030)**  \n- **Minimum**:  \n  - **CPU**: 8-core ARM v12 (with FHE accelerators).  \n  - **RAM**: 24GB LPDDR6 (for in-memory decryption).  \n  - **Storage**: 1TB optane-like NVM for block caching.  \n- **Ideal**:  \n  - **Dedicated NPU**: For zk-proof generation (~50 TOPS).  \n  - **Secure Enclave**: Apple T-series or equivalent.  \n\n **Network Infrastructure**  \n- **Memory Nodes**:  \n  - **Storage**: 100TB+ NVMe-oF (NVMe over Fabric) per node.  \n  - **Bandwidth**: 400Gbps RDMA (for low-latency block fetching).  \n- **AI Servers**:  \n  - **TPUs**: 6th-gen, optimized for FHE (hypothetical \"FHE-TPU\").  \n\n---\n\n **Challenges to Solve**  \n1. **Energy Use**: zk-proofs + FHE could spike compute needs 1000x. *Solution*: Photonic chips or reversible computing.  \n2. **Metadata Leaks**: Even encrypted, access patterns reveal info. *Solution*: *Oblivious RAM (ORAM)* techniques.  \n3. **Adoption**: Users hate managing keys. *Solution*: Social recovery (e.g., 3 friends can reset your key).  \n\n---\n\n **Why This Could Work**  \n- **User Trust**: No corporation controls your memory; you’re the custodian.  \n- **AI Utility**: Retains context across sessions *without* surveillance.  \n- **Regulatory Safe**: GDPR/CCPA-compliant by design.  \n\n---\n\n **Prototype Roadmap**  \n1. **Phase 1 (2025)**: On-device encrypted memory (Signal-style).  \n2. **Phase 2 (2027)**: zk-proofs for private context fetching.  \n3. **Phase 3 (2030)**: Fully decentralized, FHE-compatible AI.  \n\n---\n\nThis isn’t just tech—it’s a *philosophical shift* from \"AI as a service\" to \"AI as an extension of personal agency.\" The hardware *will* catch up if the demand exists.  \n", "content_size_bytes": 4338}

The batch is sent to an L1 contract (`VotingL1`) via a cross-layer call.\n\nHere are the simplified contract implementations:\n\n# L2 Contract (zkSync Era)\n\nThe L2 contract stores votes temporarily and submits them to L1 when the batch threshold is reached:\n\n    pragma solidity ^0.8.20;\n    \n    contract VotingL2 {\n        address public l1ContractAddress; // L1 contract address\n        uint256 public constant BATCH_VOTE_THRESHOLD = 1; // Threshold to trigger batch submission\n        uint256 public currentBatchVoteCount = 0;\n    \n        uint256[] private currentBatchCandidateIds; // Temporary storage for candidate IDs\n        uint256[] private currentBatchIndices; // Temporary storage for voter indices\n    \n        constructor(address _l1ContractAddress) {\n            l1ContractAddress = _l1ContractAddress;\n        }\n    \n        function vote(uint256 candidateId, uint256 voterIndex) external {\n            currentBatchCandidateIds.push(candidateId);\n            currentBatchIndices.push(voterIndex);\n            currentBatchVoteCount++;\n    \n            // Submit the batch when the threshold is reached\n            if (currentBatchVoteCount >= BATCH_VOTE_THRESHOLD) {\n                _submitBatchToL1();\n            }\n        }\n    \n        function _submitBatchToL1() internal {\n            // Submit batch to L1\n            (bool success, ) = l1ContractAddress.call(\n                abi.encodeWithSignature(\"receiveBatchVotes(uint256[],uint256[])\", currentBatchCandidateIds, currentBatchIndices)\n            );\n            require(success, \"Batch submission failed\");\n    \n            // Reset the batch\n            delete currentBatchCandidateIds;\n            delete currentBatchIndices;\n            currentBatchVoteCount = 0;\n        }\n    }\n    \n\n# L1 Contract (Ethereum Sepolia)\n\nThe L1 contract receives batched votes from L2 and tallies them:\n\n    pragma solidity ^0.8.20;\n    \n    contract VotingL1 {\n        address public l2ContractAddress; // L2 contract address\n    \n        mapping(uint256 => uint256) public candidateVotes; // Track votes for candidates\n    \n        function receiveBatchVotes(uint256[] memory candidateIds, uint256[] memory indices) external {\n            require(msg.sender == l2ContractAddress, \"Unauthorized\");\n    \n            for (uint256 i = 0; i < candidateIds.length; i++) {\n                candidateVotes[candidateIds[i]]++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n\n# Deployment Details:\n\n* **VotingL2 Contract Address (zkSync Era Sepolia)**: `0x9157167C34fc1C3A396daadcfCE93b1CfDE69Da2`\n* **VotingL1 Contract Address (Ethereum Sepolia)**: `0x7EBF808f2Ff1eEa59DE34968DACdBb48b037F3FD`\n\n# The Problem:\n\n1. I deployed both contracts on their respective networks (zkSync Era testnet for L2, Sepolia for L1) using Atlas.\n2. After casting a vote on L2, the batch does not seem to reach the L1 contract, even though the `BATCH_VOTE_THRESHOLD` is set to `1`.\n3. There’s no error message, but the L1 contract's state doesn’t update.\n\n# My Questions:\n\n1. **Gas and Fees**:\n   * Do I need to fund the L2 contract to handle the cross-layer call to L1?\n   * If yes, how much ETH is typically required?\n2. **Cross-Layer Calls**:\n   * Is the `call` method used in `_submitBatchToL1` the correct way to send data from zkSync Era to Ethereum?\n   * Should I use a specific zkSync bridge/relayer mechanism instead?\n3. **Debugging Tips**:\n   * How can I debug the L2 → L1 submission process to ensure the batch is sent and processed correctly?\n4. **Best Practices**:\n   * Are there better patterns or tools to handle batched communication between L2 and L1 contracts?\n\n# Notes:\n\nThese are sample contracts to illustrate the logic. Any guidance or corrections to my approach would be greatly appreciated!", "content_size_bytes": 4089}

Not FUD, just thinking out loud. If the maximum cap for ZK drop were 50,000 tokens (which is already quite a lot), this would free up an additional 573 million $ZK tokens for the community.\n\n16,944 wallets have 50k+ $ZK tokens, and their total drop size is 1.42 billion $ZK. If we set a hard cap of 50k $ZK for these wallets, the total drop would be 847 million tokens. In this scenario, we would have 573 million free tokens left, which could be used to make 573,000 new eligible wallets with around 1,000 $ZK each, resulting in a total of 1,268,000 eligible wallets without changing any additional metrics or criteria.\n\nEven in this scenario, a hard cap of 50,000 $ZK per wallet looks like a substantial drop. The team could still include their own wallets, just doubled in number, but their value would be diluted among all eligible wallets. A total of 1.268 million eligible wallets would result in fewer dissatisfied users and less FUD around the project.\n\nIn my opinion, the fact that the maximum cap is 100k tokens is due to the team's interest", "content_size_bytes": 1084}

I’ve been there, and honestly, I thought it was game over. But it turns out, recovery isn’t always impossible.\n\n\nBackstory: One Old Wallet, No Access\n\nYears ago, like a lot of people, I jumped into Bitcoin early and made a wallet. I stored the file, saved a few coins, and forgot about it.\n\nFast forward to this year, I finally got around to checking it again, only to realize I couldn’t remember the password. At all. I had the wallet file, but every password I tried failed.\n\nI even started thinking I might’ve used a typo when I made it. Total panic mode.\n\n\nTried the DIY Route First\n\nBefore reaching out to anyone, I went the do it yourself path. Tried dozens of combinations, installed a few recovery tools, and messed around with scripts I found online.\n\nBrute force tools helped me understand the process, but they were slow, and I wasn’t sure I was doing it right. After a few weeks, I was burnt out and still locked out.\n\n\nRecovery Services? I Was Skeptical Too\n\nEventually, I started reading recovery success stories on different forums. Most of them I ignored, too many were clearly fake or vague.\n\nBut one name popped up a few times: KeychainX. People mentioned they’d been around for a while and actually delivered for some users. I didn’t rush in. I waited, read more, then finally emailed them.\n\n\nHere’s What Surprised Me\n\nNo pressure. No hard sales. They just asked for basic info, the wallet file, what kind of wallet it was, and any password guesses I could remember.\n\nThey were upfront about what they could and couldn’t do. And they made it clear: if your wallet came from someone else or is suspicious in any way, they won’t touch it.\n\nBest part? No payment unless they succeed. That alone made me feel better about trying.\n\n\nThey Cracked It For Real\n\nTook a few days, but they got in. I didn’t think it would happen. Opening that wallet and seeing the funds still there? Unreal.\n\nAfter assuming it was lost forever, it felt like a weird kind of time travel, bringing something back from my past.\n\n\nJust Sharing My Experience\n\nI’m not here to recommend or promote anyone. This is just what worked for me after exhausting every other option.\n\nIf you’re in the same situation, maybe with an old BTC or ETH wallet, it’s worth researching recovery options. Just be smart, check the history of whoever you’re dealing with, and never send money upfront.\n\nAsk questions. Be cautious. But don’t give up right away.\n\nIf anyone’s stuck or just wants to talk through recovery ideas, happy to chat.\n\nWant to learn more? KEYCHAIN.lO", "content_size_bytes": 2660}

I'd like to share an idea for a new approach to on-chain entropy and randomness, and I'd love to get your feedback. I'm hoping to find some like-minded people to discuss it with and build it together.\n\n**TL;DR:** On-chain randomness from oracles (Chainlink, etc.) is often centralized and acts like a black box. I'm proposing a dedicated L1 blockchain (appchain) designed to be a decentralized \"Entropy Hub\" for all of web3. It would gather randomness from multiple sources (PoW miners, lava lamps, gyroscope), mix it, and allow any dApp or blockchain to pull from it for a small fee. Looking for feedback and collaborators!\n\n*Disclaimer: This post is less about academic research and more about the practical engineering and technology.*\n\n# Problem\n\nFor some context: if you're building a dApp (like a game) that needs a random number, the standard approach in web3 today is to use oracles with VRF capabilities, like Chainlink, Supra, or Gelato. You send a request in one transaction and get the random number back in a callback transaction.\n\nThe problem is, these services are often centralized and act as black boxes. Even when they use strong cryptography like VRF, they aren't fully transparent or decentralized.\n\n# Proposal\n\nSo, I thought, why not build a truly decentralized solution? An infrastructure layer that produces verifiable, unbiased entropy and serves as an \"Entropy Hub\" for all of web3.\n\n# How It Works\n\nThe core idea is to create a specialized L1 blockchain (an appchain), likely built with a framework like **Substrate**, dedicated to generating and distributing entropy. Here’s a high-level overview:\n\n1. **Proof-of-Work:** Miners use an ASIC-resistant PoW algorithm like RandomX. Instead of just securing the network, their primary job is to find and commit a high-quality **Entropy Seed** to each block they produce, earning rewards for their work.\n2. **Collection (External Sources):** We could integrate external, real-world entropy sources, similar to how Cloudflare uses lava lamps or how others use atmospheric noise. Lite-clients could help gather and validate the quality of this entropy.\n3. **Entropy Hub:** All these entropy inputs (from miners and external sources) are continuously mixed and stored in the \"Entropy Hub\" on the appchain.\n4. **Distribution:** Any blockchain, parachain, or dApp can request a chunk of entropy from the Hub by paying a small fee.\n5. **Incentives:** The fees are then distributed among the contributors (miners, external source providers) based on the quality and quantity of the entropy they provided.\n\nI want to make participation in this protocol as open and permissionless as possible.\n\nThanks for reading this far! I hope the idea is intriguing. I'm open to all feedback, critiques, and suggestions—please share your thoughts in the comments!\n\nLet's build the Entropy Layer for Web3 together.\n\n", "content_size_bytes": 2944}

Initial response was great, and few people pointed towards it's potential compatibility with smart contract. I just dropped the **no-std version** with a new feature: **compile-time enforced pure functions**. Here is how it works:\n\n## 🧠 **The #[pure] proc macro**\n\nThe `#[pure]` creates **compiler-enforced purity**:\n\n```rust\n#[pure]\nfn calculate_new_balances(ctx: TransactionContext) -> Result<TransactionContext, TokenError> {\n    // ✅ Can call other pure functions\n    let validated = validate_transfer_rules(ctx)?;  // Must also be #[pure]\n    let fees = calculate_protocol_fees(validated)?; // Must also be #[pure]\n    \n    // ❌ These won't compile - calling impure from pure context\n    // msg!(\"Logging from pure function\");  // Compile error!\n    // load_account_data(ctx.account_id)?;  // Compile error!\n    \n    Ok(apply_balance_changes(fees)?)\n}\n```\n\nOnce you mark a function `#[pure]`, it can ONLY call other `#[pure]` functions. The compiler enforces this recursively!\n\n## 🔥 **Solana Example**\n\n```rust\nfn process_transfer(accounts: &[AccountInfo], amount: u64) -> ProgramResult {\n    let context = load_initial_context(accounts, amount)?;\n    \n    let result = pipex!(\n        [context]\n        => |ctx| load_account_states(ctx)      // IMPURE: Blockchain I/O\n        => |ctx| validate_transfer(ctx)        // PURE: Business logic\n        => |ctx| calculate_new_balances(ctx)   // PURE: Math operations  \n        => |ctx| commit_to_accounts(ctx)       // IMPURE: State changes\n    );\n\n    handle_pipeline_result(result)\n}\n\n#[pure]  // 🎯 This function is guaranteed side-effect free\nfn validate_transfer(ctx: TransactionContext) -> Result<TransactionContext, TokenError> {\n    if ctx.instruction.amount == 0 {\n        return Err(TokenError::InvalidAmount);\n    }\n    \n    if ctx.from_balance < ctx.instruction.amount {\n        return Err(TokenError::InsufficientFunds);\n    }\n    \n    Ok(ctx)\n}\n```\n\n## 💡 **Why I think it matters**\n\n**1. Easy Testing** - Pure functions run instantly, no blockchain simulation needed\n**2. Audit-Friendly** - Clear separation between math logic and state changes\n**3. Composable DeFi** - Build complex logic from simple, guaranteed-pure primitives\n\n## 🛠 **For curious ones, you can include this rev to test it yourself**\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\npipex = { git = \"https://github.com/edransy/pipex\", rev=\"fb4e66d\" }\n```\n\n## 🔍 **Before vs After**\n\n**Traditional Solana** (everything mixed):\n```rust\npub fn process_swap(accounts: &[AccountInfo]) -> ProgramResult {\n    msg!(\"Starting swap\");  // Logging\n    let account = next_account_info(accounts)?;  // I/O\n    if balance < amount { return Err(...); }  // Validation mixed with I/O\n    account.balance -= amount;  // State mutation\n}\n```\n\n**With Pipex + #[pure]** (clean separation):\n```rust\npipex!(\n    context\n    => |ctx| load_accounts(ctx)        // IMPURE: Clear I/O boundary\n    => |ctx| validate_swap(ctx)        // PURE: Isolated business logic\n    => |ctx| calculate_amounts(ctx)    // PURE: Mathematical operations\n    => |ctx| commit_changes(ctx)       // IMPURE: Clear persistence boundary\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR**: Pipex no-std brings functional pipelines + compile-time pure function enforcement to Solana. This could lead to more secure, testable, and efficient smart contracts with clear separation of concerns.\n\nRepo: [ https://github.com/edransy/pipex/tree/no_std ]\n\nWhat do you think? 🎉", "content_size_bytes": 3501}

Most of the ideas I mention may have been existed before, but hey this is one man's ideas!  \n  \n**Before we start**  \n  \nIf you like working on any of these ideas and you think you can help as a co-founder, feel free to DM me. I check this website almost everyday and read new topics. So I may spend a few more minutes to read and answer DMs as well!  \n  \n**A little bit of my background**  \n  \nAlthough I have introduced myself before, I have to say this May I became 30 and I have experience of coding in different languages since the age of 12. At the age of 15, I made my very first app and sold it to a local real estate agency (it was just a sales management system written in Delphi and used Access as database!).  \n  \nAnyway, in March of 2023, I founded [Mann-E](https://mann-e.com/) which is an AI image generation platform. Since the day I launched Mann-E, there were suggestions for making it a web 3 based company but I never could find a good way to connect my business to web 3.  \n  \nIn this topic, I have ideas for a bunch of new *company* or *startup* ideas which can be easily integrated with web 3 (at least in my opinion) and I really need your thoughts on the topics as well.  \n  \nNow, let's go and review the ideas.  \n  \n**Idea 1: Generative Metaverse**  \n  \nIn my AI journey, I have came across some models for turning text prompt or image prompts into 3D files (mostly GLB files). So a place where people can get their hands on a piece of *virtual land* and design their monuments or houses with AI can be a cool idea.  \n  \n**Idea 2: Generate to Earn system**  \n  \nOkay, this is directly inspired by projects such as *tapswap* and *Hamster Kombat* but instead of making you busy with a Telegram mini app, you'll be busy by a website where you are generating images and by doing each generation you'll be rewarded. This idea came to my mind because in the whole path of my business of generative AI, I had struggles finding good data (mostly prompts to feed to different AI systems such as midjourney to generate a synthetic set of data). This way, you are providing the data for future AI systems and get a reward in form of a token.  \n  \nBut there is a problem here, who will invest on this idea? for example in previous idea, people may pay for 3D generation or may pay for the virtual land. How can we provide liquidity for the token proposed by this one? Community? Those \"Blockchain Grant\" systems? what? I really want to know this.  \n  \n**Idea 3: Bet on Sports Matches**  \n  \nI guess the whole game of bet/gamble in crypto space is much older than what I can think of. However, it was an idea in my mind.  \n  \n**Idea 4: Voting System**  \n  \nIt can be a fraud-proof voting system with little to no cost compared to traditional voting systems in organizations of syndications. For examples *Association of Digital Businesses* in my country had an election and they had to rent a whole hotel for 3 days in order to host all people to vote on candidates from different cities/provinces. If a voting system exists, they just pay a small fee for creating a new vote and the whole voting thing will be done on the chain with zero chance of vote fraud.  \n  \n**Idea 5: A crypto bank where people can turn their crypto assets into real world assets**  \n  \nI see websites similar to this before, but the idea is cool. Imagine you buy iTunes gift cards or any other similar goods with your crypto assets!  \n  \n**Idea 6: OF but on chain**  \n  \nIt seems controversial of course. But imagine a lot of people do not want a history of selling and buying that type of content in their credit card history. So why not making something on chain in order to help people have a safer place to buy and sell this type of content? Obviously it is more complex than it seems but this is the idea!  \n  \nWhat do you think about these 6 ideas? I tried to sort them from the safest to the craziest. I also am waiting for your input on this as well.", "content_size_bytes": 4178}

The idea is simple — but potentially powerful:\n\nWhat if it were possible to speculate on sentiment around public and private institutions — not just their stock price, but actual trust?\n\n⸻\n\nCore Concept:\n\nEach institution would have:\n\t•\tA Sentiment Contract (ERC-20 token) representing public trust.\n\t•\tA Public Trust Index (PTI) — a dynamic score from 0–850 based on user voting.\n\nUsers could:\n\t•\tLong, short, or hold sentiment contracts (via perpetuals or buying the token outright).\n\t•\tVote on the PTI — even without holding the token (holding gives your vote more weight).\n\t•\tTrack and speculate on public perception in real time — even for private companies like OpenAI, SpaceX, or TikTok.\n\n⸻\n\nWhy This Matters:\n\nMarkets already move on narrative. But there’s no transparent, on-chain way to speculate on trust itself — especially when public sentiment and market performance don’t align.\n\nToday, a company can have strong financials and still face widespread public distrust. Or vice versa. There’s a growing disconnect between Wall Street performance and real-world perception — between shareholders and actual consumers.\n\nThis protocol would aim to bridge that gap.\n\nThe goal isn’t to build a “truth oracle” — but rather a trust oracle: a way to capture sentiment, quantify it, and allow people to trade on it. Just like traders speculate on earnings or macro forecasts, this would let users speculate on public narratives — with 24/7 access, no KYC, and full transparency.\n\nIt would create an open speculation layer for credibility itself — something that could exist outside traditional finance.\n\n⸻\n\nOpen Questions I’m Still Thinking Through:\n\t•\tWould this feel useful, or too abstract?\n\t•\tWhat mechanisms could help limit whale manipulation of PTI scores?\n\t•\tShould token holders be rewarded for holding vs. trading?\n\t•\tAre there any protocols I should study for architectural inspiration?\n\n⸻\n\nI’m not a developer yet, but I’m learning.\nIf this concept resonates — or if you want to critique it, build on it, or collaborate — let’s talk.\n\nThanks for reading, I appreciate any and all feedback 🙏\n", "content_size_bytes": 2319}

The concept of equity multiples such as  the P/E ratio (price to earnings) is incredible useful in evaluating a company and their potential to produce returns based on their earnings.\n\nNow the P/E ratio is hard to apply to all tokens because not all tokens have the concept of earnings, but it's no secret that for a project/company to survive it has to have income to pay the bills, even if its in the form of donations or tokenomics.\n\nHere's what I've come up with so far - basically trying to find P/E equivalents for different types of crypto protocols:\n\n**1. Fee-Distributing Protocols (the \"dividend stocks\" of crypto)**\n\nFor protocols that actually share revenue with token holders, I'm using:\n\n* **P/DE ratio** = FDV ÷ Annual Distributed Earnings\n* Think of staking rewards, fee sharing, etc.\n* Based on some solid research from Sockin & Xiong's 2022 RFS paper on equity tokens and the recent NBER working paper by Cong on PoS valuations\n\n**2. Buyback & Burn Protocols (like corporate share buybacks)**\n\nWhen protocols burn tokens instead of distributing:\n\n* **P/BV ratio** = FDV ÷ Annual Burn Value\n* ETH post-EIP-1559 is the obvious example here\n* Grayscale did some good analysis on this, plus there's academic work from Cong & van Oordt at BIS\n\n**3. Utility/Infrastructure Tokens (think SaaS metrics)**\n\nFor tokens that are primarily used within the protocol:\n\n* **P/PR ratio** = FDV ÷ Annual Protocol Revenue\n* Or the classic **NVT ratio** = Market Cap ÷ Daily Transaction Volume\n* Burniske popularized NVT back in 2019, and there's newer NBER research from Cong et al. on network valuations\n\n**4. Governance & Treasury Tokens (NAV-style approaches)**\n\nFor DAO tokens with significant treasuries:\n\n* **MC/TA ratio** = FDV ÷ Current Treasury Assets\n* **P/TI ratio** = FDV ÷ Annual Treasury Inflow\n* Still emerging research here but some interesting work coming out on DAO treasury management\n\n**5. Store-of-Value Assets (commodity models)**\n\nFor Bitcoin and similar:\n\n* **NVT**, **Stock-to-Flow**, **Metcalfe's Law** applications\n* PlanB's S2F model gets a lot of attention, though it's controversial\n* Some interesting academic work on liquidity pricing from Caginalp & Caginalp\n\n**Bonus: Relative Valuations**\n\nAlso experimenting with:\n\n* **Relative P/E**: Token P/E ÷ Sector P/E\n* **Beta-adjusted P/E**: Token P/E ÷ Beta\n* Using indices like CRIX or DeFiX for benchmarking\n\n**My questions for you all:**\n\n1. Does this framework make intuitive sense? Any glaring gaps?\n2. What metrics do you actually use when evaluating projects?\n3. Anyone have experience applying these in practice? What worked/didn't work?\n4. Am I missing any key research or industry analysis?\n\nReally curious to hear from folks who've tried to bring more rigor to crypto valuations.

I’m working on it solo, and it just went live on Arbitrum testnet.\n\nThe idea behind it is simple, but also kind of personal.\n\nWeb3 is supposed to be open and fair. But in practice, a lot of the people who actually help projects grow , the ones writing threads, making content, improving UX, fixing bugs, or spreading ideas, get nothing in return.\n\nNo allocation. No visibility. Not even a record that they were part of the story.\n\nAxynom is a protocol that tries to fix that. It runs on something I call *Proof of Growth*, a system where anyone can contribute to the project, and if that contribution adds value, it’s reviewed, approved, and rewarded.\n\nWhen that happens, the contributor earns something called *Growth Points* (GP). These are recorded on-chain and tied to your wallet. They act both as a kind of reputation and as a reward currency. Right now, GP can be redeemed for AXY tokens on testnet. After launch, those tokens will be redeemable one to one for mainnet AXY.\n\nThe system already works.  \nYou can submit work.  \nIt gets reviewed.  \nIf approved, GP is minted and added to your on-chain profile.  \nYou can claim tokens right now.  \nThere’s nothing to wait for.\n\nA few early contributors have already joined. The hub is up, the smart contracts are deployed, and the process from contribution to reward is live.\n\nThis is still early. It’s small.

The recipient only receives the crypto if they *open*the message. If they don’t, the crypto automatically returns to you after a set time (like 7 days). It’s all handled via smart contract — no middlemen.\n\nIf they like your message, they can choose to respond. If they don’t, no hard feelings — your funds are returned.\n\nIt’s a new way to cut through the noise, especially in a world where cold DMs and unsolicited emails rarely get noticed. With Priority Ping, attention becomes opt-in, incentivized, and respectful.\n\nWe’re designing it as a lightweight layer on top of Web3 identities — compatible with wallets, ENS, Lens, Farcaster handles, etc. Think of it like a trustless “stamp” for messaging.\n\n**Why it might work:**\n\n* **For senders:** You only spend if your message is actually opened. You’re no longer shouting into the void.\n* **For receivers:** You’re compensated for your time. No more endless spam or bots — only signals with some skin in the game.\n* **For both sides:** It’s fair, permissionless communication with built-in incentives.\n\nWe’ve had people compare it to Balaji’s Earn (but with refunds), and some say it feels like a Web3 postal service — especially with how expensive real-world postage has become. Businesses that send regular letters (like banks) could eventually use this to communicate on-chain more efficiently.\n\nOf course, this only works if the UX is simple enough. We’re building with wallet-native flows so that receiving and reading a message feels like opening an email — no technical steps, no clunky interfaces.\n\nNow we’re testing the concept with the community and would love your thoughts:\n\n* Would you use Priority Ping to reach someone important?\n* Would you be open to receiving messages like this?\n* What kinds of messages would you expect — or want — to see?\n* What concerns do you have around abuse, privacy, or UX?\n\nWe’re not trying to replace messaging apps — we’re building a tool for when something is *important*, and attention needs to be earned.\n\nAppreciate your honest thoughts, both good and bad.

When this happens, mining rewards will drop from 1 TAO to 0.5 TAO per block until there are none. \n\nRecycling: Every time a miner or validator register, their TAO goes back to the \"issuance pool\".

Both are pursuing aggressive $TAO accumulation, supported by BitGo custody and staking infrastructure.

That’s fine today, but once quantum hardware advances enough, those exposed keys could be reversed to steal funds - especially from dormant wallets that can't move fast enough to a safer scheme.\n\nI know that the narrative in the crypto space has historically disregarded the threat as being 20-30 years out, but with new advances in quantum computing seeming to come out every week, this seems to be more and more a present-facing threat.\n\n* NIST has already selected post-quantum signature schemes.\n* Google, IBM, and others are accelerating quantum hardware development.\n* Apple is implementing PQC in their iMessage service.\n* Lockheed Martin filed a patent to use QRL in communications devices.\n\nDespite all this, most of crypto is acting like this is a 2040 problem.  If we wait until there’s a credible quantum adversary, it will already be too late.  Wallets can be drained if even a handful of qubits scale the right way.

This system is designed to prevent excessive accumulation and maintain economic stability via decentralized, self-regulating mechanisms.\n\nKey Concepts:\n\nLabor Tokens (TT): Digital currency minted from validated labor.\n\nToken Burning: Tokens are destroyed after each payment.\n\nDecentralized Validation: Automatic, obligatory, or community-based validation methods.\n\nDynamic Coefficient (C(t)): Adjusts token issuance based on real-time sector productivity.\n\nDemurrage: Tokens lose 1% monthly if unused for 90 days.\n\n\nCore Mechanisms:\n\n1. Token Generation\n\nValidated tasks generate NFTs known as Labor Records (LR), converted into TT via smart contracts.\n\n2. Token Burning\n\nPayments trigger TT burning and automatically create new LR tokens representing seller labor.\n\n3. Decentralized Validation\n\nAutomated validation (IoT, APIs)\n\nCommunity validation (DAO with reputation)\n\nRotational obligatory validation (all participants periodically validate tasks)\n\n\n4.

I started out as a developer maintaining a legacy .NET app with infrastructure in AWS. That’s where I first got interested in cloud architecture, which eventually led me down the AWS certification path and into more formal infrastructure and DevOps roles.\n\nI’m deeply interested in cryptocurrencies because of their potential to decentralize and democratize transactions. I am venezuelan, and in 2017/2018 I was able to send money to my family through [localbitcoins.net](https://localbitcoins.net/) in a very difficult time when all international transactions were blocked, Cryptocurrencies were (and still are) a lifeline for many people. Btw, I truly recommend [https://whycryptocurrencies.com/](https://whycryptocurrencies.com/), really good lecture, it really inspired me to start working on this project.\n\nUntil I started this project, I felt wary of cold wallets, mostly because I didn’t really understand how they worked internally. I never felt comfortable with anything other than MetaMask (though I’m not a huge fan of storing keys in browser storage either). Another app I used a lot is LemonCash, which functions more like an exchange, letting you use crypto and automatically convert it to pesos while supporting different tokens, so I decided to build a desktop cold wallet in Go, something that sits between both applications.  \n  \n Investigating about frameworks I ran into wails, and I decided to start building the HD wallet, not to create a product but to learn in the process and get familar with the industry.  I've been building it since January, in the beginning I thought of supporting a few tokens (like USDC, ETH, BTC, SOL).  At the moment I have only managed to build the ETH infrastructure, but this has turned into the side project I’ve stuck with the longest.   \n  \nUntil now, I’ve been building it quietly and sharing progress within my personal network. But with the amount of time and thought I’ve put into it, I felt it was time to open it up to the community, get feedback, and maybe even find people interested in contributing.  \n  \nHere’s the repo: [https://github.com/deaconPush/ubiDist/tree/main/wails/wallet](https://github.com/deaconPush/ubiDist/tree/main/wails/wallet), and here is a video with a basic [demo](https://files.catbox.moe/x8pzhr.mp4).   \n  \nIt’s still rough around the edges, and as it is my first Go project the structure is still pretty raw. I’ve been focusing on keeping the architecture flexible and avoiding overengineering. So far, I’ve implemented a basic UI to create and restore wallets, store data in a SQLite DB, and send ETH transactions to other accounts using the local Hardhat network. Next steps include improving security, adding integration tests, helpful logging, and starting to add support for new tokens.  \n  \nI’ve always been a big fan of open source but never had the self-confidence to contribute, maybe this is my way into that world.\n\nThanks for reading, happy to connect with like minded engineers/crypto enthusiasts!\n\n", "content_size_bytes": 3110}

Chainless Apps rethink dApp architecture from first principles. What Are Chainless Apps?  \nChainless Apps separate execution from trust and settlement. That’s the core idea.  \nInstead of being tightly coupled to a blockchain for every state change, Chainless Apps execute off-chain, prove correctness using verifiable computation (zkVMs, AVSs, or TEEs), and settle via the Agglayer into Ethereum.  \nThis enables:\n\n* Web2 responsiveness\n* Web3 verifiability\n* Seamless cross-chain UX\n\n Architectural Overview  \nChainless Apps are composed of four distinct, modular layers:\n\n1. **Execution Layer** – App-specific, off-chain logic that runs at native speed.\n2. **Trust Layer** – Flexible verification options (zkVMs like RiscZero/Succinct, AVSs via EigenLayer, or TEEs).\n3. **Bridge Layer** – Unified asset/message routing via the Agglayer.\n4. **Settlement Layer** – Anchor trust proofs to Ethereum (or the Agglayer itself in the future).\n\nEach application gets its own execution and trust environment, while inheriting Agglayer’s unified bridge and settlement layer. This allows for high throughput, lower cost, and superior UX — without sacrificing verifiability. Trust That Scales  \nWe don't dictate how apps establish trust — we give you a menu:\n\n* **zkVMs (e.g. RiscZero, Plonky3)**: Cryptographic proofs of correctness\n* **AVSs (e.g. EigenLayer)**: Committee-based attestation\n* **TEEs (e.g. Intel SGX)**: Hardware-secured execution\n\nDevelopers choose the model that best fits their application’s needs. The system is modular from day one. The Role of Agglayer  \nAgglayer connects Chainless Apps to the rest of Web3:\n\n* **Unified Bridge**: Native routing for assets and messages across chains\n* **Pessimistic Proofs**: Prevent over-withdrawals and race conditions\n* **Fast Interop (coming soon)**: Sub-second messaging between chains\n* **Proof Aggregation (coming soon)**: Bundle ZK proofs across apps to minimize L1 cost\n\nThe result is a shared liquidity layer across applications and chains — composable, verifiable, and synchronized. \n\nProof-of-Concept: zkSpot\n\nWe built zkSpot to demonstrate what Chainless Apps unlock.  \nIt's a high-performance spot exchange that runs app logic inside a TEE, then proves correctness via zkVM. With fast settlement, native asset support, and Agglayer routing, zkSpot behaves like a CEX — but is verifiable like a DEX.  \nThis model generalizes to any interactive or high-throughput app:\n\n* Real-time games\n* Social protocols\n* Prediction markets\n* Enterprise dashboards\n\n**Learn More**  \nThis work builds on prior concepts like A-Z apps and modular rollup architecture. We’re grateful to the teams at Polygon Labs, Succinct, RiscZero, EigenLayer, and others whose research contributed to this system.  \n\n\nRead the whitepaper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22989](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22989)\n\nDeep dive blog: [https://agglayer.dev/blogs/chainless](https://agglayer.dev/blogs/chainless)", "content_size_bytes": 3324}

This applies not just to memecoins or purposeless tokens, but even to legitimate projects with real innovation and flawed tokenomics.\n\n**My proposed solution:** A design that converts chaotic momentum into stable, gradual growth using math and a touch of community coordination.\n\n**Feasibility rationale:** Tokens like DAI prove that the power of math and community can stabilize the price of a coin and peg it to a value. We can apply the same principle power with a different design but **instead of a stabilized peg, a stabilized growth.**\n\nI have in mind a complete technical design and the ability to implement it, primarily in solidity (for eth or an eth based chain). It is completely trustless with no centralized control and includes a semi-DAO mechanism where users can collaborate and direct the assets backing their tokens into permissioned smart contracts so they can capitalize on the assets they control but can't force use the assets of others.\n\n**Key Features/Properties:**\n\n* Tokens acquired directly from the protocol can have a \"forever break-even liquidity\" while the price is algorithmically designed to grow at a stable pace.\n   * (For a CEX to utilize this feature they would have to integrate the smart contract interaction. People who spot trade it are exposed to financial loses).\n* Token-backing assets are not trapped and can be funneled for utilization .\n* Protocol users can vote/vouch.\n   * Protocol fees for yield.\n   * Growth parameters (within pre-limits).\n   * Prevent the release of team tokens.\n      * Don't like the team? Vote that they'd get nothing.\n   * Funnel funds to an external contract using a minimum threshold at deadline logic.\n* Verify onchain a statement they made. An immutable proof that they said what they said.\n* A complete fair launch with a given grace period to join at the base price before growth logic initiates.\n   * A genuinely benevolent trustless design. \"A token Coffeezilla would be proud of\".\n\n**Reasons for me not to do it:**\n\n* I lack marketing skills.\n* I lack visual design skills (I can do a practical UI but not a conventionally beautiful/attractive design).\n* UX may be complex.\n* Team disincentivized. My intent for a fair financial design may discourage potential collaborators.\n* Regulatory gray zone due big brother progress proroguing governments.\n* Hard work and effort that requires motivation I don't currently have.\n* \"Too Ethical for Degens\" In this market, many people want to gamble and see 100x returns within a few days, they don't appreciate steady appreciation and those who do lean toward Bitcoin and large blue chip coin.\n\n**Reason why it should be done:**\n\n* Addresses a Real Problem. Offers an innovative low risk financial opportunity that is brave enough to see beyond short term greed.\n* Innovative Tokenomics\n* Built-in Integrity. Potential collaboration with Tegridy Farms.\n* Realistic semi-DAO features. Community-driven, but without the overly complex systems that open the door to protocol-killing exploits.\n* A fair, trustless, ethical undertaking.\n* Could be fun\n* Could be profitable\n* Within my capabilities if I find the right support\n\n**Thoughts?**", "content_size_bytes": 3298}

I would appreciate any thoughts/ideas here, as I'm still not sure if it would actually work in practice. Thanks!\n\n**Delayed Proof-of-Work (DPoW)**\n\nA theoretical consensus mechanism for energy-efficient, time-regulated mining.\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1. A new block is added to the chain.\n2. All miners start computing a VDF (Verifiable Delay Function) with the latest block's hash as the input.\n3. The VDF is designed to take 4 minutes to complete, enforcing a mandatory idle period.\n4. The \\~1 minute mining period begins when miners complete the VDF.\n5. Miners compete to find a valid PoW for a new block, which includes the VDF output in the header.\n6. The first miner to find a valid hash broadcasts the new block to the network.\n7. The block is verified by nodes by checking the VDF's output is correct for the previous block hash, and that the PoW is valid.\n\nThis cycle of a 4 minute idle period and a brief mining period continues.\n\n**Key Advantages**:\n\n* The idle-mine cycle allows the network to operate with \\~1/5 of the hash power of a standard PoW blockchain while still taking advantage of the security properties of PoW.\n* During the 4 minute idle period, the blockchain is guaranteed to be static. The predictable delay means blocks are propagated and confirmed in a more synchronized fashion, which could reduce synchronization issues and orphaned blocks.\n\n**Potential Issues:**\n\n* VDFs can be computed slightly faster on hardware with higher clock speeds or specialized circuits, resulting in some miners having a longer mining period.\n* The short mining-window means that miners on faster connections will have a significant advantage over slower connections, as they will be able to propagate a mined block faster.\n* The VDF also uses energy, although negligible compared to the amount that algorithms use.\n* Miners might redirect their hash power to other cryptocurrencies during the delay period, which would undermine the goal of reducing energy consumption.\n* A malicious miner who obtains or predicts the next block could start precomputing the VDF early, gaining an unfair advantage.", "content_size_bytes": 2201}

The simplest way to think of it is as a standardized language that defines communication between the hardware and software.\n\nThough RISC-V was not originally built for blockchain purposes, its open design allowed crypto developers to leverage it for building virtual machines that could generate zero-knowledge proofs at far lower resource costs than the EVM.\n\nThe outcome is what’s known as a zero knowledge virtual machine (zkVM), which enables developers to write applications in high level languages like Rust without needing to be trained in cryptography.\n\nIn the absence of zkVMs, companies that want to leverage zk tech to build a privacy-secure application to process payroll/healthcare data would need to spend much more time writing custom zk circuits that cannot be easily changed after deployment (unlike a zkVM where devs could simply recompile RISC-V code).\n\nThoughts?", "content_size_bytes": 1568}

Please chime in to refine this. So, my project is using zero-knowledge proofs and I am finding out that people who are not familiar with the concept (and even those who think they are) are struggling to understand it. I came up with a story below to help non-technical and technical people understand how this would work on a blockchain.\n\nSo, here goes:\n\nJohn has $1,000 and needs to send $100 to Bill. Nobody can know the amounts that are being sent or how much money John or Bill has. \n\nLet's break this down.\n\n1. John owns $1,000.\n\nInstead of waving cash around, he seals the money inside a thick, light-proof envelope. Before he seals it, he presses a special wax stamp that embeds a cryptographic code tied to \"$1,000 + some random noise.\" That stamp is tamper-evident: anyone can scan it later and be certain nothing inside has been swapped, yet the scan reveals zero about the real amount.\n\nThe stamp fixes the value without exposing it.\n\n2. Splitting the funds - still in the dark.\n\nJohn now prepares two new opaque envelopes:\n\n\\- Envelope A (for Bill)  \n\\- Envelope B (change back to John)\n\nHe secretly puts $100 in A and $900 in B, adds fresh random noise to each, and presses a new wax stamp on both. Again, the stamps hide the figures but lock them in place.\n\n3. The referee's balance test.\n\nA neutral blockchain referee (software, not a person) receives only the three stamp codes, never the cash. With some clever math the referee checks two rules:\n\n\\- Conservation: \"Stamp(original) = Stamp(A) + Stamp(B)\"  \n\\- Range proof: each new envelope holds a non-negative amount (no hidden debt).\n\nBecause the math is homomorphic (computations can be performed without decryption), the referee can confirm both rules without peeling open any envelope.\n\nIf the equations hold, the referee signs a one-line certificate: \"John's transfer verified - no amounts disclosed.\"\n\nThat certificate (the zero-knowledge proof) is what gets written to the next block.\n\n4. What the world sees.\n\n\\- Everyone can audit the certificate and know the transaction is sound.  \n\\- Nobody learns that Envelope A contains $100, or even that Bill is receiving $100 instead of $5,000 or $42.  \n\\- The original and change amounts stay private, yet the ledger's arithmetic stays perfect.\n\nSummary:\n\nZero-knowledge proofs are like tamper-proof stamps on opaque envelopes: they let the blockchain confirm that John's $1,000 was correctly split into a payment and change without ever revealing how much cash sits inside each envelope.", "content_size_bytes": 2557}

Additionally, I am not citing the name of my project, or trying to promote it in any way, just looking for advice from fellow developers.\n\n\n\nThat said, a little context. The distributed capability of blockchain tech is what originally drew me to the crypto space 10 or so years ago. I have always loved the concept of essentially using greed as a key motivator to create a secure and trustless asset. I find it inspiring, as fundamentally, no ecosystem can exist free of avarice, and historically, the accumulation of malefactors is what inevitably degrades the integrity of the system. Although far from perfect, the opportunities created by this technology seems to offer the closest function for turning the greed of potential bad actors into a positive force, by rewarding meritorious action such as mining, staking, and auditing, to such a degree that it disincentivizes defectors.\n\n\n\nLooking at what other issues that blockchain could potentially create merit based cooperation for universal good in, one of the biggest economic complaints that seems to constantly plague the world, regardless of nation, political affiliation, ect... is the poor management of inflation, leading to ever increasing escalation and instability of financial assets. Cryptocurrencies have already made inroads into this issue, such as with Bitcoin having a finite supply, and thus a deflationary trajectory, or in the case of dozens of cryptos that have regulated, transparent inflation rates.\n\n  \nIt occurred to me though that although many cryptocurrencies have decentralized consensus that controls one or more aspects of the tokens inflation / deflation, I cannot think of one that has put full control of both mechanisms into the hands of the token holders. There are clear reasons for this, and in many cases I can fully understand why the developers would not want to risk bad actors having any part of their tokens minting and burning rates, nor is it appropriate most of the time. \n\n\n\nStill, the idea is intriguing, for, if given the opportunity, would a community of token holders be capable of self regulating the use of inflationary and deflationary mechanisms, ultimately working together to build the ecosystems financial value and stability, or, would short term greed and \"pump and dump\" malefactors overwhelm the system and cause a total loss of stability?\n\n  \nPersonally I find the concept to be fascinating, so out of curiosity, a little over a year ago, I started building a token model to test this socioeconomic theory, as well as my own programming ability. Since then I have gone through several revisions, with my first few concept designs falling apart almost immediately do to architecture flaws, exorbitant on-chain fees, extreme transaction latency, and issues incorporating off-chain entities. However, about a year later and I have created what I am confident is a functional and working prototype to test my thesis, building my model using the EIP-2535 standard, with independent facets for the inflationary and deflationary modules that can be activated and deactivated via a staked voting mechanism by token holders, and with certain mechanisms, once activated, relying on off-chain entities via a ZK Rollup to handle computations to cut gas fees, with off-chain \"nodes\" handling the off-chain computations, and incentivized through the ability to host and profit from staked tokens to their nodes. Bad actors can be penalized for trying to use a node to send corrupted information by quarantining of the effected node, and both node operators and token holders are incentivized to partake in voting by the direct impact on the total supply of the token. In order to ensure that the token is not pushed to a unsustainable supply in either direction, the supply is \"rubber-banded\", ensuring that the further the supply gets from the initial supply, the more difficult activating and maintaining the supporting mechanisms will become.\n\n\n\n It was particularly challenging, as prior to this project I have never worked with either the EIP-2535 standard or ZK Rollups, and I stumbled more then I would like to admit.\n\n  \nAll of this is to say, I am looking for input, criticism, and questions that can help me hunt down any remaining flaws that I may have been to close to the project to see, prior to its launch. Shortly after I first started this project, I posted an inquiry here about potential mechanisms to integrate into the token, and some of the responses I got were quite inspired. I am hoping that this post may evoke some similar insights.\n\nThank you for your time reading this, and for your responses if you are so inclined.", "content_size_bytes": 4870}

But a closer look at how eth_decrypt functioned reveals cracks in this reasoning, suggesting the decision might mask a deeper motive.\n\nHere’s how it worked: eth_decrypt and eth_getEncryptionPublicKey relied on asymmetric encryption. A third party could use eth_getEncryptionPublicKey to fetch a user’s public encryption key, derived from their Ethereum private key (ECDSA on secp256k1). They could then encrypt data—potentially vast amounts—using this key, e.g. via ECIES (Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme). The wallet owner would decrypt it with eth_decrypt, using the same private key that signs transactions (e.g., via eth_signTypedData_v4). MetaMask argued that this dual use could expose the private key, risking account security\n\nBut this doesn’t hold up under scrutiny. In asymmetric encryption, the public key is meant to be shared—encrypting millions of messages with it doesn’t inherently compromise the private key, provided the scheme (like ECIES) is secure with proper nonce usage and authentication. Decryption with the private key is distinct from signing; it doesn’t generate a public output like a signature does, so the \"same key\" risk feels overstated. True vulnerabilities—like padding oracle attacks or side-channel leaks—would stem from implementation flaws, not the concept itself. Yet MetaMask’s 2023 blog post admitted no known exploits existed. If the risk was theoretical, why axe a feature that enabled private on-chain communication\n\nThe \"same key\" argument fits symmetric encryption better, where one key handles both encryption and decryption, amplifying misuse risks. But eth_decrypt was asymmetric, making the justification seem misapplied. MetaMask pledged support for a new encryption standard, like EIP-5630 (proposed in 2022 for safer key derivation via eth_performECDH), but as of April 2025, it’s still unfinished, leaving developers in the lurch.

They will stop only once the total cost of production equals the total block reward (i.e. when marginal profit == 0)\n\nHowever, not all PoW protocols are as maximally energy-inefficient as Nakamoto Consensus. Some PoW protocols reduce waste and redundancy from uncle and orphaned blocks by reusing normally-discarded blocks.\n\n**TL;DR**:\n\n* **PoW Longest-chain**: Makes blocks expensive to produce with constant difficulty adjustments. All effort is discarded/wasted except for blocks produced in the longest-chain. Has weak economic security incentives. Weak to 51% attacks.\n* **PoW DAG**: Makes blocks cheap to produce. Accepts all valid blocks without discarding. Has moderate economic security incentives, but weak spam-protection. Strong against safety-type 51% attacks, but weak against liveness attacks.\n* **PoW GHOSTDAG**: Makes blocks cheap to produce. Accepts nearly all valid transactions. Has moderately-strong economic security incentives. Strong against safety-type 51% attacks, and moderately-strong against liveness attacks.\n* **PoS DAG**: Makes blocks cheap to produce. Accepts all valid blocks without discarding. Has strong economic security for both safety and liveness.\n\n-------------------------------\n\n**Longest-chain is an Energy-spending maximizer**\n\nBitcoin's longest-chain/heaviest-weight is a family of consensus protocols that maximizes energy-spending (and e-waste production) until the marginal profit reaches zero. It will stop only when the cost of production exceeds the security budget from its block rewards.\n\nEven as mining rigs become more efficient at producing SHA256 hashes (CPU -> GPU -> ASIC -> faster ASIC), the never-ending difficulty adjustments completely nullify that efficiency increase.\n\nThere is major miner misalignment of economic incentive under longest-chain because those providing security (miners) do not have the same goals as those receiving the security (holders).\n\n**Is it possible to design a PoW protocol that is less wasteful?**\n\nThe main problem with longest-chain is that it wastes computations. Everyone is trying to build a block, but everyone's efforts get thrown out while only the winner's block is accepted. One way to decrease wastefulness is to not discard effort. There is a way to use discarded blocks under which is to use other consensus protocols like DAGs and GHOSTDAG.\n\n**What is a DAG, and why is it more efficient and more secure?**\n\nA DAG is another category of Distributed Ledger Technologies (blockchains are also DLTs), that has a mesh-like structure instead of a linear chain of blocks (e.g. blockchain). All valid blocks are accepted, and none are thrown away unless they're invalid or have bad signatures. Thus nothing gets wasted. Blocks are connected to each other like a mesh and ordered based on time-equivalents. Nano and the original IOTA (it later upgraded to PoS) are both PoW DAGs, and they're both extremely efficient.\n\nComputations are not wasted, and there doesn't need to be a constant difficulty adjustment. Blocks are constantly being produced at low cost (sub-pennies) and high throughput (thousands of TPS).\n\nIn addition, longest-chain protocol is weak to 51% attacks, especially when block production is slow and there is a pool of transactions waiting to be added (a mempool). When block production is fast and the pool is usually empty, reorg and censorship attacks from 51% attacks become largely irrelevant. Sure, blocks can be reorged or censored, but the throughput is so high that transactions get added anyways by other miners seconds after the attack. So the attack only affects other miner's block rewards, which are mostly insignificant anyways. This nearly nullifies the effectiveness of 51% attacks.\n\nTechnically, there is no mining for adding transactions. The mining is mainly for spam-prevention, which is an issue I will cover later.\n\n**What is the GHOSTDAG consensus protocol?**\n\nGHOSTDAG is a portmanteau of GHOST (Greedy Heaviest Observed SubTree, Ethereum's original PoW protocol) and DAG.\n\nLongest-chain protocol throws away blocks that are not in the longest-chain. Those discarded blocks are called uncle or orphaned blocks. GHOST uses uncle and orphaned blocks as part of the weight calculations for determining the heaviest-chain, which makes it more secure and efficient than vanilla longest-chain.\n\nGHOSTDAG goes a step further than GHOST. There are 2 versions of this. One version includes orphaned blocks into the chain in a pseudo-DAG-like manner. The other option discards the blocks, but includes the transactions from those discarded blocks as long as they're valid. Either way, computations are not being wasted. They have the same benefits as a DAG.\n\nUnlike with Nano's version of a DAG, GHOSTDAG (Kaspa's previous consensus protocol) has actual mining, which is mainly used for both spam-prevention and for security.\n\n**What's the downside with DAGs?**\n\nThere's always a tradeoff. For DAGs with high throughput, it's spam.\n\nLongest-chain's ultimate goal is to maximize energy-spending (and e-waste production) until the block reward is expended. DAG's goal is to maximize block production until transaction demand is fully-met.\n\nDAGs are so fast and efficient at producing blocks that they can become extremely spammy and sometimes have issues with liveness.\n\nNano had this problem because it went to the extreme of having no fees. Everyone was a miner, and everyone was constantly producing blocks. This leads to storage bloat and increased node/RPC hardware requirements. Mining was practically costless, but full nodes were not being compensated for storing the full ledger, and ledgers can grow very quickly when throughput is high.\n\nThus DAGs need some kind of process to reduce spam. Nano adds a small Proof of Work mechanism to combat spam, but they probably didn't go far enough. Nodes/RPCs are still not being compensated, and they're partially responsible for security. GHOSTDAG improves on this by requiring miners and a transaction fee paid to miners. This lessens the burden for security on uncompensated nodes and shifts it to the miners.\n\nSo it's possible to produce a partially secure, safe, and efficient PoW by using DAGs or GHOSTDAGs. There is still some minor/miner misalignment of economic incentive because under PoW, those providing security do not have the same economic incentives as those receiving security.\n\n**PoS DAGs**\n\nGoing one step further ...\n\nA PoS DAG protocol is even more secure. On top of all the benefits of DAGs, now validators are economically-compensated for providing security, and they have economic incentive to provide security, so the interest of those providing security and those receiving security are aligned.", "content_size_bytes": 6956}

There have been plenty of PoW blockchains with smaller security budgets that have been ruined by 51% attacks, which led to large reorgs or double-spends. Historically, Bitcoin's security budget has increased between each cycle, but this increase has been decreasing from the start, and has now reached an inflection point. Transaction fees on average still only cover 1% of the block reward and are completely insufficient to cover for Bitcoin's security.\n\nAs of March 2025, Bitcoin security budget, when CPI-adjusted, has **declined over 45%** in real value compared to 4 years ago (sources: \"Miners Revenue\" from Blockchain.com, CPI data from St. Louis FRED).\n\nThere is a well-studied, recent research paper covering this long-term systemic risk to Bitcoin:\n\n**\"The Imminent (and Avoidable) Security Risk of Bitcoin Halving\"** - https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4801113\n\t\nThis research paper from Apr 2024 analyzes the long-term effects of Bitcoin halvings on Bitcoin's security budget and Bitcoin's security.\n\nDue to the halvings, Bitcoin's security relative to the amount being protected (aka the \"security budget ratio\") roughly halves every 4 years. Transactions fees have not been rising enough to make up for the loss in block subsidy. In fact, transaction fees on average still only cover 1% of the total block subsidy. The Cost of Attack (CoA) on Bitcoin is expected to continue declining in the long run.\n\n####**The researchers identify many major long-term issues for Bitcoin's security model**:\n\n* **Misaligned security incentives**: Bitcoin miners are profit-driven. Unlike with PoS, Bitcoin miners do not have strong economic incentive to protect Bitcoin when mining is no longer profitable. There is economic loss in protecting Bitcoin against a strong 51% attacker.\n* **Declining security budget ratio**: The \"widening divergence between the decreasing security budget and the rising total value of Bitcoin has been identified as a substantial long-term security problem\".\n* **Price instabilities**: \"can push mining activity far below its equilibrium value\" where \"the hash rate required by a 51% attacker is substantially reduced\"\n* **Secondary markets from unprofitable mining**: \"In our default scenario, the 28% of miners that become unprofitable in post-halving equilibrium may be willing to sell their hardware. Then an attacker who aims to acquire 50% of the total hash rate could buy this cheap hardware.\"\n* **Cost of Attack**: Was previously expected to be $5-20B in mining equipment, but possibly much cheaper due to secondary markets. Ongoing cost is $100M/day cost for maintaining a 51% attack.\n* **Timing attacks**: Due to difficulty adjustments around halvings, the total hash rates can be up to three times lower than before the halving, making Bitcoin 3x easier to 51% attack.\n* **Insufficient Transaction Fees**: Transaction fees on average have not risen at all, and are too low to cover for the loss in block subsidy from halvings\n* **Goldfinger attacks**: \"Stakeholders with intentions to undermine Bitcoin or profit from short positions may actively engage in Goldfinger attacks\"\n\nNote that the researchers based their figures on S9 ASIC miners since those are readily available on secondary markets. The CoA using newer S19 and S21 miners should be even cheaper by up to 3x because they are much more efficient.\n\n####**Possible solutions**\n\nThe authors recommend several solutions, all of which require controversial hard forks.\n\n* Removing supply cap and having permanent block subsidy issuance\n* Imposing minimum mandatory transaction fees\n* Switching to other more secure consensus protocols (like PoS)\n* Using a gradual inflation-reduction curve to eliminate sudden shocks in mining drops from halvings\n* Implementing a smaller max difficulty-adjustment\n\nTheir primary recommendation is to remove the supply cap and allow for permanent sustainable block subsidy issuance. It is questionable whether the Bitcoin community will accept many of these proposals.", "content_size_bytes": 4273}

Homomorphic Commitments (HC) for Coins\n\n* **Coin Representation:** Each coin is represented by a **cryptographic commitment** (e.g., Pedersen Commitment) that conceals the coin’s value using homomorphic encryption.\n* **Ownership:** A user “owns” a coin by holding the **secret blinding factor** (the opening) of the commitment.\n* **Spending Process:** Spending a coin invalidates the old commitment and generates a new one, ensuring only unspent commitments remain valid.\n\n# 2. Coin Issuance & Initial Distribution\n\n* **Decentralized Launch Mechanism:** A **ZK-proof-secured launchpad** allows early participants to mint coins by proving computational work or stake via privacy-preserving methods (e.g., ZK-SNARKs).\n* **Vesting Contracts:** Coins allocated to core developers/validators are locked in time-released contracts (e.g., 3-5 years) to prevent premine abuse.\n* **Dynamic Supply:** A minimal inflation rate (1-2% annually) funds staking rewards, incentivizing long-term validator participation.\n\n# 3. DAG Referencing for Spent-Commitment Accumulation\n\n* **Transaction Nodes & Multiple Parents:** Transactions form nodes in a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**, referencing multiple parent commitments to establish lineage.\n* **Conflict Resolution:** Each commitment can only be spent once; referencing the same parent in multiple transactions triggers a conflict resolved via heaviest-subtree rules.\n* **Append-Only Structure:** The DAG enforces a partial ordering of spends, enabling efficient pruning after finalization.\n\n# 4. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) for Privacy & Integrity\n\n* **Proof at Spend Time:** Every transaction includes a ZKP verifying:\n   1. Ownership of the spent commitment.\n   2. Valid transition to new commitments.\n   3. Conservation of value (inputs = outputs).\n* **Batch Proofs:** Use **recursive SNARKs** to aggregate proofs for entire DAG branches, reducing verification overhead.\n* **Hybrid Privacy:** Users can opt for transparent UTXO-style transactions (no ZKP) for non-sensitive transfers.\n* **Hardware Acceleration:** Optimized ZKP backends (e.g., Groth16 on GPUs, Halo2 on FPGAs) accelerate proof generation/verification.\n\n# 5. Avalanche-Style Probabilistic Finality + Minimal PoS\n\n* **Probabilistic Sampling:**\n   * Transactions are repeatedly sampled by random validator subsets.\n   * Acceptance requires **supermajority approval** (e.g., 95% stake-weighted consensus).\n* **Validator Economics & Security:**\n   * **Fee Market Integration:** Transactions bid fees in the native token, distributed to validators. Fees escalate during congestion.\n   * **Slashing Conditions:**\n      * **Double-Voting:** Validators endorsing conflicting transactions lose staked tokens.\n      * **Liveness Faults:** Persistent offline validators face partial slashing.\n   * **Delegated Staking:** Small token holders delegate stake to professional validators, improving decentralization.\n* **Consensus Enhancements:**\n   * **BFT Finality Gadget:** A Tendermint-like BFT layer finalizes checkpoints after dispute periods, resolving network partitions.\n   * **Data Availability Sampling (DAS):** Erasure coding ensures checkpoint data remains available even if 25% of validators disappear.\n\n# 6. MMR-Based Accumulators for Global Pruning\n\n* **Spent-Commitment Updates:** Spent commitments are appended to a **Merkle Mountain Range (MMR)**, an append-only accumulator.\n* **Global MMR Checkpoints:** Validators finalize MMR snapshots via BFT consensus every epoch (e.g., 24 hours). Pruning deletes pre-checkpoint DAG data.\n* **Light Client Efficiency:**\n   * **P2P Attestations:** Light clients query multiple peers for MMR roots, cross-validating via majority consensus.\n   * **Fraud Proofs:** Compact proofs allow nodes to challenge invalid checkpoints, enabling light clients to reject bad states.\n\n# Optional Enhancements\n\n# A) PoH-Like Timestamps (Specialized Time-Stamping)\n\n* **Objective:** Use a **Proof of History** mechanism to timestamp DAG transactions, simplifying conflict resolution.\n* **Benefit:** Provides canonical ordering for forks and reduces reliance on network timestamps.\n\n# B) Chain-Key Threshold Signatures\n\n* **Mechanism:** Validators collaboratively sign MMR checkpoints using **BLS threshold signatures**, producing a single compact signature.\n* **Benefit:** Light clients verify checkpoints with one signature, reducing bandwidth overhead.\n\n# C) VDF (Verifiable Delay Function) for Spam Prevention\n\n* **Design:** Each transaction requires a **VDF proof** (e.g., 2-second delay) to deter spam.\n* **Adaptive Difficulty:** Difficulty adjusts based on network load (low during normal use, high during attacks).", "content_size_bytes": 5136}

This wasn’t a novel idea on my part, of course, but from what I’ve gathered based on a quick Google search, it seems like most of the discussion around this topic has been around the use of blockchain technologies to create a complete, end-to-end voting system that would completely replace our current voting system.  From what I can tell, though, it seems like there may be some significant vulnerabilities associated with blockchain voting systems (fraud, manipulation/exploitation, etc.) that would need to be addressed before the blockchain could be taken seriously as a viable option to completely replace our existing voting systems, ya?  \n\nWhat I’m wondering, though, without getting into any of the details of how a potential blockchain system that’s similar to what I’m envisioning would actually operate, I’m curious if there are any potential practical applications to use blockchain technologies to create some sort of separate but parallel system (as opposed to a system that would completely replace the existing voting system) that could help support/substantiate the results of a free and fair election… Or that - in the event that there had been widespread election fraud/interference - could at least provide some sort of initial indication that there had been so that there would at least be some justification for there to be some type of additional audit process and/or investigation to ensure that the election had indeed been fair and free.  \n\nTruthfully, though, I don’t really know too much about how our current voting system in the US functions, and even less about crypto and blockchain technologies, unfortunately.  So… with that disclosure out of the way, I guess I’d like to know if there would be any value in creating a blockchain system that could provide a real time “shadow count” of the votes that are being cast during an election, whereby individual users would be able to submit their “digital ballot” to the blockchain, which would allow the system to keep real time vote counts based on each individual user’s voting district.  The rationale being that if the official vote tally were to deviate significantly from the blockchain’s vote count (or vote ratio, at least), then that might be a red flag for society at least to look into the matter a bit more closely, perhaps?  And also, another potential function/feature of this system might be for there to be a means by which, once the official ballots had finally been counted, users could check and verify that their official ballot had been processed correctly and that the votes on their official ballot aligned with the votes that they’d included on their digital/blockchain ballot, and if there were some sort of discrepancy, users could report or flag it somehow through the blockchain so that it would be possible to identify any instances in which there appeared to be an inordinate amount of flags/reports in a particular area/district that may have been associated with some sort of election interference, perhaps?  \n\nAnyways, I’m sure that there’s a million potential issues that I’m not even considering here and it’s also very possible that this is a dumb idea that’s not even worth responding to, but in the off chance that there’s some kind and knowledgeable Redditor out there who’s willing to indulge my curiosity, I figured I might as well ask.  So, yeah, what do you think?  What sorts of things would I need to consider if I were to create such a system?  Major obstacles in developing and/or maintaining it?  Major limitations?

If Apple would allow users to disable automatic updates only for certain individual apps (such as hot wallets for example), and if they would allow checksum verifications with source code in some way, then the user could update to a new version on their own once they verify and audit the code themselves, or allow time to pass for others in the community to do so, etc.\n2.

However to question material provided by Princeton would seem inconceivable. So I would like to ask this subreddit for clarification before I make a fool of myself in front of my professor. But I genuinely understand this book to be misrepresenting the merkle tree structure. I would APPRECIATE your feedback to my post and let me know what you think. Have I misunderstood something? Is the book making an error?\n\nOk, on to the material. Here is a direct quote from the book.\n\n>Suppose we have a number of blocks containing data. These blocks comprise the leaves of our tree. We group these data blocks into pairs of two, and then for each pair, we build a data structure that has two hash pointers, one to each of these blocks. These data structures make the next level up of the tree. We in turn group these into groups of two, and for each pair, create a new data structure that contains the hash of each. We continue doing this until we reach a single block, the root of the tree.\n\nHere is a corresponding figure presenting a merkle tree structure from the book:\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/UnpEjqJ.png](https://i.imgur.com/UnpEjqJ.png)\n\nREBUTTAL:\n\nThe specific grievance is:\n\n>we build a data structure that has two hash pointers, one to each of these blocks.\n\nI claim this is not the case(with sources provided later). I claim the data structure(parent node) that is made for each pair contains the hash of the concatenation of the children. So if there is a pair of leaves A and B, the parent node does NOT contain two hash pointers for each leaf which is written as H(A) H(B) in the book's diagram. Instead, it contains a single hash of both A and B concatenated, that is  denoted as H(A||B).\n\nFurther, there are no pointers which let you instantly hop from the parent to its children. The only way to find the child given a parent in practice is by using index arithmetic because all of the nodes in a binary tree can be denoted using indexing. And indexing follows a structure that lets you navigate the tree.\n\nI claim the above misunderstanding leads to a further misunderstanding regarding a proof of membership. As I understand, a proof of membership is the same as a proof of inclusion and a merkle proof.\n\nHere is the text from the book:\n\n>Proof of membership. Another nice feature of Merkle trees is that, unlike the block chain that we built before, it allows a concise proof of membership. Say that someone wants to prove that a certain data block is a member of the Merkle Tree. As usual, we remember just the root. Then they need to show us this data block, and the blocks on the path from the data block to the root. We can ignore the rest of the tree, as the blocks on this path are enough to allow us to verify the hashes all the way up to the root of the tree. See Figure 1.8 for a graphical depiction of how this works.\n\nHere is a diagram they provide:\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/A5KKDJO.png](https://i.imgur.com/A5KKDJO.png)\n\nREBUTTAL: Consider a trivial example of a merkle tree where it contains 3 nodes.  It has a root. The root has 2 children(leaf nodes in this case). Also assume a merkle tree is structured as I claim: The leaf nodes contain hashes of their corresponding datablocks. The parents of these leaf nodes contain the hash of the concatenated child hashes. And any further parents are recursively constructed in the same fashion.\n\nGiven this simple case, let the datablocks be denoted as A and B. Then one leaf node contains H(A) and the other contains H(B). The parent contains the hash H( H(A) || H(B) ).\n\nI want to prove the membership of the datablock A. The book claims I need only provide the direct path from root to leaf node of A. And I claim this is NOT enough information. Suppose I do as the book states and provide the root and the leaf node containing H(A). First providing the leaf node H(A) is actually redundant. Anyone can fabricate the correct hash of a datablock on the fly. What we really want is a piece of information that confirms H(A) is indeed part of this tree where the hashes propagate upward to the root - and where the root is combined authenticator for all the elements in the tree. Ok so maybe adding the root will provide enough information? If I observe the hash stored in the root which is the output of H(H(A)||H(B)). Well this is NOT helpful!

But one of the most interesting (and underrated) use cases is prediction markets. I honestly think they could be a huge part of crypto’s future.\n\n# What’s a prediction market?\n\nIt’s basically a way to bet on real-world events—elections, sports, stock prices, anything. If you think something will happen, you buy “Yes” shares. If you think it won’t, you buy “No” shares. The price moves based on what people believe the probability is. It’s like a stock market for real-world events.\n\n# Why does this matter for crypto?\n\n* They’re actually useful – Instead of just trading meme coins, prediction markets provide real-world value by showing what people *really* think will happen.\n* Less censorship – A lot of places ban certain types of betting (especially political betting), but decentralized markets are harder to shut down.\n* One of the best real uses for crypto – People always ask what crypto is actually *good for*. This is one of the best answers.\n* Better than traditional betting – No middlemen, lower fees, and the odds are set by the market instead of bookies.\n\nPlatforms like Polymarket and Augur are already doing this, but it still feels early. If crypto is going to have real-world applications, **prediction markets could be one of the biggest.**\n\nCurious to hear what others think—are prediction markets the next big thing, or is something holding them back?", "content_size_bytes": 1563}

This process is **energy-intensive** and relatively **slow**.\n* **XRP (Ripple)**: Uses the **Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm (RPCA)**, which relies on a network of **trusted validators (Will talk about these later)** to reach consensus on transactions. It is **faster**, more **energy-efficient**, and does not require mining.\n\n  \n**Transaction Speed**:\n\n* **Bitcoin**: **10 minutes** on average due to the time required to mine each block.\n* **XRP**:  **3-5 seconds** due to its lightweight consensus algorithm. Very fast.\n\n  \n**Scalability (TPS-wise)**:\n\n* **Bitcoin**: Processes about **7 transactions per second (TPS)**. Scaling has been a challenge due to its block size and consensus model (?)\n* **XRP**: Can handle up to **1,500 TPS**, making it more suitable for large-scale, high-frequency use cases like global payments.\n\n  \n**Purpose**:\n\n* **Bitcoin**: Designed as a **decentralized digital currency** and store of value, often referred to as \"digital gold.\"\n* **XRP**: Primarily developed as a **bridge currency** for cross-border payments and facilitating fast, low-cost transfers between financial institutions.\n\n# Combined Benefits for Financial Technology:\n\n1. **Improved Efficiency**: Bitcoin’s decentralization and XRP’s speed/low cost can complement each other in creating hybrid systems that are both secure and scalable.\n2. **Reduced Costs**: Both cryptocurrencies eliminate the need for traditional intermediaries, reducing inefficiencies in transaction and operational costs between countries.\n3. **Innovation in Payment Systems**: By integrating blockchain technology, Bitcoin and XRP can inspire new solutions for digital payments, lending, and \"**ASSET\"** tokenization.\n\n  \nSome questions that I have:\n\n1. Can both co-exist with each other later?  \n2. Is XRP decentralized or centralized?  \n\n* Validators on the XRP Ledger include universities, financial institutions, and independent organizations, making the network less reliant on Ripple Labs.\n* Since Ripple Labs created XRP and still holds a significant portion of its supply (over 40 billion XRP in escrow). This concentration of ownership can give Ripple Labs significant influence over the XRP market, defeat the purpose of decentralized currency like bitcoin.\n\n  \nPlease correct me if I have any mistakes and I hope we could learn from each other :) Thank you!", "content_size_bytes": 2954}

Think of them as a vault for processing data while keeping it private.\n* **Blockchain Integration**: By coupling TEEs with Oasis’s blockchain, computations performed inside these secure enclaves can be verified using cryptographic proofs. This guarantees that the AI models and their outputs haven’t been altered.\n* **Why It Matters**: This combination enables decentralized applications to maintain both transparency and privacy, solving a key issue for industries that rely on sensitive data, such as:\n   * **Healthcare**: Securely analyzing patient data without exposing it to breaches.\n   * **Finance**: Ensuring fraud detection algorithms operate as intended without bias or interference.\n   * **Government and Compliance**: Proving compliance with regulations while maintaining data confidentiality.\n\nOasis Protocol is paving the way for AI systems to gain trust in critical applications where verifiability is essential.

The core idea of this algorithm is to enhance both transaction confidentiality and user anonymity without compromising the integrity of the blockchain itself. This is achieved primarily through the use of pseudonyms for each transaction, and I'd love to explain how it works!\n\nKey Features:\n\n1. Pseudonyms for Sender and Receiver:\nEvery transaction on the blockchain involves a pseudo-generated public address for both the sender and the receiver. These pseudonyms are essentially temporary identities tied to a private key that can only be used for that specific transaction. By doing so, the blockchain ensures that there is no direct link between the user’s real-world identity and their on-chain activities, enhancing privacy.\n\n2. Transaction Fragmentation:\nTransactions are fragmented into smaller parts that are independently validated, meaning that even if parts of the transaction are intercepted, it becomes nearly impossible to reconstruct the full transaction. This ensures extra layers of security and privacy.\n\n3. Dual Validation by Two Groups of Miners:\nTo further enhance security, two separate groups of miners validate different aspects of each transaction. This reduces the risk of malicious actions and ensures that the integrity of the transaction is always maintained.\n\n4. Cryptographic Protections:\nI’ve incorporated zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), ring signatures, and other advanced cryptographic techniques to guarantee that transaction details remain private while still allowing for secure verification on the blockchain.\n\nWhy Pseudonyms?\n\nThe use of pseudonyms in this system allows for complete privacy—even when transactions are verified, there is no way to trace back the transaction to any real-world identity unless the user explicitly reveals it. This is a key feature for anyone concerned with maintaining their privacy in a blockchain environment.\n\nAdditionally, it provides a layer of security against tracking and surveillance by making it incredibly difficult to correlate transactions between different pseudonyms, even if they are used by the same person.\n\nWhat’s Next?\n\nI’m hoping to take this concept further and eventually bring it to the real world. The system is designed to be scalable, meaning it can grow alongside the adoption of blockchain technology while maintaining privacy and security for all users.\n\nIf you’re into blockchain tech, privacy, or cryptography, I’d love to hear your thoughts and any feedback you might have!\n\n\nThis blockchain algorithm uses pseudonyms for both sender and receiver, transaction fragmentation, and dual miner validation to ensure maximum privacy and security while maintaining a transparent and secure blockchain ledger.", "content_size_bytes": 2854}

The ones that do will probably only play a minor role in the future of finance. There’s a lot to say so I’ll focus on what I see as the fundamental issue: **trustless and decentralized financial systems, no matter how well-engineered, fail to meet basic user needs.**\n\nCrypto overlooks the need for **oversight and intervention**. Without it, systems become dangerously exploitable. Crypto wallets often lack government IDs and use irreversible, sometimes untraceable transactions, making them prime targets for theft. As adoption grows, so might scams, threats, and violence. Without oversight, crypto can also be used to hide and launder money, promoting tax fraud and other criminal behavior.\n\nTraditional bank accounts, in contrast, incorporate measures like withdrawal limits, fraud detection, transaction traceability and reversibility, and compliance checks (KYC and AML). These safeguards require centralized authorities with power and thus DeFi lacks foundational security.\n\nSome argue that crime is minimal relative to total crypto transactions. Yet crypto grants users the freedom to commit these crimes if they choose, and the ease of doing so could incentivize tax fraud and other crimes. So while I admit privacy is important, your actions can’t be totally anonymous. Crypto is akin to having no police in a city.\n\nUsers are also fully responsible for their private keys, and that responsibility often leads to lost or accidentally destroyed wallets. Proper storage means creating multiple backups and maintaining a highly secure physical environment—no small task, especially when millions of dollars could be on the line. For most people, it simply isn’t practical or safe to manage that level of risk themselves. The sensible solution, in my view, is to rely on a centralized, trustworthy entity—i.e., a bank.\n\nHopefully, this illustrates the flaws in DeFi and why banks and governments remain necessary. For those who still believe a trustless blockchain is the solution where users bank themselves, remember that today’s “trustless” blockchains aren’t truly trustless. Oracles—offchain data sources that link onchain—cannot be verified cryptographically. While aggregation from multiple oracles can reduce risk, collusion remains possible.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is that **trust is indispensable, despite its imperfections.** Instead of eliminating trust, we should focus on making our institutions more trustworthy—a far simpler approach. To replace TradFi, crypto would need to replicate thousands of centralized features in code—fraud resolution, asset recovery, tax compliance, oracle verification, criminal law, and more. This would require an enormous infrastructure of decentralized nodes running millions of lines bug-free code, making complex, nuanced decisions—well beyond current technology. And since “code is law,” human intervention would be nearly impossible when mistakes occur.\n\nMaybe once we reach AGI, decentralized altruistic AI agents could run the financial system. Until then, I remain skeptical that most cryptocurrencies have any real, lasting value.\n\nEDIT: I wrote this post right before learning that OpenAI announced o3, which some say is AGI 🙊 \n\nThere’s a lot I didn’t say because this is long enough but I think there is some good in blockchain via taking elements of it and applying them to centralized, permissioned systems.

Can anyone here help? These mostly relate to scaling.\n\n1. We all know that multiple copies of the complete chain are held on mutiple machines (some explanations say \"by every device participating in the chain\" although I suspect thst is not really the case!) So, my first area of interest is the size of the chain / data storage requirements. I have no idea how much disk space a single block takes up, but that is largely irellevant. If a particular chain is old and popular, surely it wil evenbtually grow to a size that makes it impractical? Can anyone comment?\n2. The classic explanation of how a cryptocurrency works, is that the chain represents a ledger of all transactions. In order to figure out a particular address's balance (to see if they have enough to make a transaction) the explanation then basically states that the whole chain / ledger is scanned for transactions involving that address to calculate the balance. So, related to Q1, how is that done efficiently? I mean, if I have a chain that is (say) 10 years old, with several tens of billions of transactions in the ledger, wouldn't searching the chain for every transaction involving a particular address take an impractical amount of time? (Say, I have a waller running on my smartphone, how can it perform that search efficiently?) Or is there some clever algorithm in play here?\n3. How is the \"winning\" miner decided upon? Regardless of \"proof\" somehow one entitly must \"win\", sign the block, add it to the chain and claim the reward? Again, say we have several thousand miners (and nodes) it's not unreasonable for more thsan one to get a solution before consensus can be reached. Given that the whole point is to have no central control, who gets to decide? Doesn't network latency get in the way?\n4. I have a basic understanding of \"Proof of Work\" and how thi has led to a crazy amount of power being used on a glovbal scale for mining operations, but how do other systems work (\"Proof of Stake\" / \"Proof of Storage\" etc.) and why are they more efficient? Do they also not have to \"solve\" the block in the same way that PoW systems do?\n5. Who actaully executes smart contracts? By which I mean, where is the code actually run? Is it the miner? If so, how do we ensure that if the contract references external entites, it is only done once?\n\nThanks for reading this.

While I am continuing to broaden my understanding about crypto and the blockchain, I'm really interested in recommendations for some more specific research. Right now I have a massive funnel of information and I'm basically choking on it all.\n\nWhat really interests me is the potential for crypto and the underlying tech to make private equity and venture capital obsolete, as businesses, creators, and developers are able to use tokens to leverage their community as investors who want to directly support products/people/ideas they believe in and cut out the middle men of VC/PE and wall street (I currently hold stock in some VC/PE firms registered as BDCs because that's as close as I can get to those market opportunities, and also the whole \"accredited investor\" thing is BS, but I digress.) - something in between crowd funding and IPOs that are superior to both.\n\nI had an \"aha\" moment when I was learning about how smart contracts have been used to code royalties into NFTs and stuff, and realized that this technology is vastly superior to the current way that basically the whole stock market operates. In my hopium-fueled future, shareholder agreements are coded on the blockchain and stock is replaced with tokens - and obviously not just stocks, but all sorts of asset classes, IP, etc, that most people don't currently have good access too.\n\nI believe this is referred to as \"tokenization\" - but I'm still learning all the vocabulary - and also there seem to be a lot of different players out there talking about tokenization as part of their use case, but I'm not sure they all mean exactly the same thing or have the same vision for what that looks like.\n\nIf anyone could recommend specific cryptos that are working on this use, I will happily dive into them. I would prefer better known projects as opposed to deep-in-the-weeds altcoins, but if you think the technology is really compelling then I'm happy to look at it and learn even if only for my own edification and better understanding.\n\nThe four that I am currently studying are Ripple, Cardano, Chainlink, and Polkadot - not specifically for what I mentioned above, but because they're the ones that are on my current reading list, although they all do seem to have some aspect of tokenization to them (opinions on these welcome).\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n  \nP.S.

Once payment is confirmed, the decryption key is securely released to the buyer.\n4. The platform includes a **rating system** for buyers and sellers to build trust.\n\nKey Features:\n\n* No files or documents are stored on the site. Only a decryption key for said item.\n* Even if I wanted to investigate what’s being bought or sold, I wouldn’t be able to, since the files and transactions are separate. So 100% anon.\n* The system relies entirely on the **validity of the key** and the buyer’s ability to decrypt their file.\n\n# My Concerns:\n\nI’m worried there might not be enough demand for a system like this. It seems like there are limited use cases where total anonymity is essential.\n\n* Do you think this is a dumb idea?\n* Are there specific use cases or scenarios where this would make sense?\n* What would make you trust such a platform?\n\nSay you want to buy a digital good (e.g., a license key, encrypted document, or script) in complete privacy. The seller won’t just send it to you because they can’t be sure you’ll pay. That’s where our site comes in:\n\nThe seller encrypts the digital good and submits the **decryption key** to our site. The actual encrypted file remains wherever they choose—Dropbox, a USB stick, email—completely outside our platform.

You can then use the decryption key, on the encrypted file inorder to recieve your product.\n\n1. **Trust**: The seller is guaranteed payment, and you’re guaranteed the decryption key.\n2. **Anonymity**: Since we never handle or store the file, even we couldn’t determine what’s being bought or sold.\n3. **Security**: The process is entirely focused on the key, leaving the file’s storage up to the buyer and seller.\n\nOnly thing missing is the buyer needs to trust the seller, this I would use a rating/comment system for.\n\n  \nI’d really appreciate any constructive feedback or suggestions.
