What course of mathematics is bitcoin investing strategies based upon? \n3. Why do bitcoin enthusiasts seem to reject the material origins of money and commodity production and exchange?\n\nI love that the bitcoin community shows fervor in wanting everyone to be financially independent and \"thrive\" under capitalism. However, this fervor promptly comes to an end with a pessimistic conclusion: \"people need to just be smarter, like me!\" The capitalist system won't allow for the vast majority of people in societies worldwide, who happen to be workers, exploited and subjugated by the ruling class, to be free of its stranglehold. \n\nI worry that combining religion and/or spirituality with a committed detachment of material history of how economic relations have developed up to the present day is grounds for yet more alienation from each other, and also extreme idealism. It's saying, \"I don't need to know about how things work, i just need to trust that capitalism will sort things out in my favor.\" \n\nDavid Graeber is no help. He has pointed out only that work under capitalism is bad, and completely gives up on a way forward for the working class. He holds disdain for historical materialism, and has no sense of global economic relations. Because he thinks workers are stupid, there's no wonder why he doesn't think the working class is capable of self-organizing and expropriating the wealth of the fortune 500 companies and running the economy in the interests of the majority. \n\nThe stock exchange is very interesting but it is still owned by the ruling class, and decides the fate of millions of people.

But i have yet to see a post that formulates un unbiased objective opinion on either one of the subs. \nI, myself, have bought and sold Bitcoin more than a few times and i find myself undecided on wether it is or not a good investment.\nIs it an alternative to fiat or a store of value? Or a pyramid scheme? Nobody can truly be sure, therefore i am trying to mediate a discussion between the 2 communities so i can get a better view.\nI doubt Bitcoin will ever replace fiat. The central bank will launch their own digital currency if needed. But crypto and fiat can coexist via a simbiotic relationship, as it has so far. The descentralized and untracability aspects are pros, as i find it hard to believe the price will drop down massively since BTC and other cyrptos are used for illegitimate activities all around the world.\nOn the other hand, crypto seems to have lost its way as a pure form of payment. It has become more like a store of value, but without real assets guaranteeing its value (like stocks). It is deflationary but i can’t understand why the price would ever grow more than the rate of inflation. And there are a lot of investments that protect you from inflation with a lot less risk.\nI do not believe crypto is the revolutionary idea bitcoiners say it is but i still find myself using it as a form of payment to invest in Counter Strike skins. One could say the value of CS skins is just as absurd as crypto, therefore i am torn.\nI am looking for opinions. Do you use crypto? Do you invest in it or just use USDC for payments like myself? Where do you see this ending? What pros/cons am i missing? \nMy understanding of the blockchain is raw at best so keep that in mind. Thank you for your time.\n\n\n\n", "content_size_bytes": 1876}

{"uri": "https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1m1686f/is_the_nothing_at_stake_problem_exaggerated/", "datetime": "2025-07-16T07:24:29", "source": "REDDIT", "label": "ethereum", "content": "Given a rule that `(blockheight-skipped)` is treated equivalent to \"length\" or \"total difficulty\" in proof-of-work, and assuming fixed slot time, the validators will converge on the chain that has the majority of validators. Any attempt to somehow build on an infinite number of forks because double-signing is possible (whereas in PoW it is impossible) will not lead to the honest majority following along, as those \"alternative forks\" will never become the \"longest\" (in terms of least skipped) chain. So in order to actually pull of an attack based on that you have \"nothing at stake\" you need to be the majority, i.e., >51%. Whenever you are the majority, you are already free to attack the network as you want as nothing protects it against 51% attack, the security model in Nakamoto consensus (or traditional solution to Byzantine Generals Problem) is an *honest majority*. Given this, you can also notice that the reason Satoshi used PoW was *not* because double-signing was impossible, it was probably primarily because it has random validator selection built in (whereas with proof-of-stake you need to also solve random number generation), and much like the ancient Greeks Kleroterion it is the \"democratic lottery\" that was the basis of Nakamoto consensus. Bootstrapping a proof-of-stake system back in 2009 would have been a lot more complicated. From that you can notice that those who shouted about \"nothing at stake\" because \"there was something at stake in PoW\" may have misunderstood things, they assumed the \"no double signatures\" was somehow essential but it was probably not the feature that made PoW ideal for a first version of \"democratic lottery\" to control a computer platform.\n\n**Edit:** \"balance attacks\" is what many assume is detrimental if there is \"nothing-at-stake\". With the fork choice rule `(blockheight-skipped)` and fixed slot times (and assuming a validator order is pre-decided for a \"period\" of N blocks or days or similar), even starting such an attack (managing to get two forks that partition the validator pool) requires that the attacker has two slots in succession. This happens fairly often for attacker that is something like 5-15% of all stake. The attacker then has to skip two slots on the honest chain, X+1 and X+2 while  creating an attacker chain where they claim that the honest validator at block heigh X skipped their slot. At block height X+2, the attacker chain will then have a score of 1 point more than the honest chain. The automatic fork choice rule will then cause part of the validator pool to start to follow the attacker chain. Then, the attacker can try and do a \"balance attack\" by skipping slots selectively on whichever fork starts to get more and more validators to converge on it. To achieve this attempt at an attack, the attacker first has to pay two slots (i.e., not get block reward for two slots) and they then have to continuously pay slots as they skip slots to attempt to maintain a \"balance attack\".\n\nThe way \"nothing at stake\" is typically described, it is assumed most of the validator pool will simply choose to build on all possible forks and not use the fork choice rule (i.e., use a modified client that skips the fork choice rule and accepts all forks as valid). This assumption seems completely wrong. But, a \"balance attack\" is theoretically probably possible, but that is not where emphasis is usually placed when \"nothing-at-stake\" problem is described. The \"balance attack\" seems extremely convoluted, and being able to somehow \"steer\" a validator pool partition so that there is never convergence on one fork seems a bit like trying to sail against the wind. My post here was downvoted into oblivion (actually an 18% upvote rate at the moment! and there was at least a number of upvotes so that is quite a few downvotes on an already invisible post!), but to me it seems like the problem might be exaggerated. So-called \"slashing\" or some kind of penalty can of course deter it, if the problem is realistic, and that is already used with PoS Ethereum. But to me the threat does seem exaggerated.\n\nAnd to consider spontaneous forks that an attacker can operate on to do \"balance attacks\", the emergence of such spontaneous forks is low probability to start with. It requires one validator to be \"near the deadline\" when publishing their slot, so that the next validator assumes they skipped, and it requires that the next validator was allocated two slots in succession. Then, the fork will start to attract validators from the validator pool via the fork choice rule. Such a situation is low probability, meaning most forks for \"balance attacks\" have to be initiated manually at a cost of two skipped blocks (and no guarantee of successful attack, as such attack does not seem easy at all, and has a constant cost from having to skip blocks as that is the *only way to balance points* between the two forks).\n\nFactor in the fork choice rule that given equivalent \"points\" it is the smaller block height that wins, and the probability of a spontaneous fork is even lower. It is not nothing but it is very small, so most \"balance attacks\" would have to be manually initiated forks, and then you have a cost of two skipped blocks to start with, with no guarantee of a successful attack, and unclear gain from succeeding the attack (many hypothetical benefits such as double spending and similar but in the case of such ongoing attack no exchange would accept \"finality\" anyway, and the attack is always very apparent as you end up with only half the validators signing blocks...)\n\n    // Local and external difficulty is identical.\n    // Second clause in the if statement reduces the vulnerability to selfish mining.\n    // Please refer to http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ie53/publications/btcProcFC.pdf\n    reorg := externTd.Cmp(localTD) > 0\n    tie := externTd.Cmp(localTD) == 0\n    if tie {\n        externNum, localNum := extern.Number.Uint64(), current.Number.Uint64()\n        if externNum < localNum {\n            reorg = true\n        } else if externNum == localNum {\n            var currentPreserve, externPreserve bool\n            if f.preserve != nil {\n                currentPreserve, externPreserve = f.preserve(current), f.preserve(extern)\n            }\n            reorg = !currentPreserve && (externPreserve || f.rand.Float64() < 0.5)\n        }\n    }\n\nYou also have very clear way to see that an attack is happening (otherwise convergence would happen... so it is easy to see) and when it started and who started it. So manually siding with the \"honest chain\" is quite easy, probably.\n\n\"Slashing\" is pretty straight forward and easy to add as a safeguard even if the \"nothing-at-stake\" problem is exaggerated, but I do think it might be exaggerated. I am also not sure if the model where each block has a \"score\" in proportion to the stake of the person who signs it (assuming some PoS systems work like that) is very good, as they get massively amplified influence (one, higher probability of being selected, and two, more \"points\" for each block they produce also) but maybe most systems do not use that?", "content_size_bytes": 7109}

I am the inventor of Bitpeople (dot) org that was invented between 2015 and 2018 in collaboration with \"bitnation\" (I since distanced myself from \"bitnation\" because their vision is wrong, I can specify how if anyone is interested). It was originally called Virtual Pseudonym Parties or Online Pseudonym Parties, then for a short time Pseudonym Pairs. I also built a people-vote consensus engine a year and a half ago (under my Swedish foundation Panarchy foundation that also develops Bitpeople), and have now spent half a year solving the \"reserved payment attack\" in multiphop payments (this is not under my foundation, it is part of a separate and older project called Resilience as it required such a solution).\n\nThe \"Achilles heal\" in Bitpeople is the man-in-the-middle attack and this has been very openly communicated since 2020-something probably. There are many different ways to solve it (i.e., to establish a secure channel). I have left the problem open over the past 5 years or so, and prioritized things such as\n\nI think one of the most secure might be the \"lock & key\" video chat handshake. It is quite simple. Both people in the pair commit (encrypt and share with the other person) a video plus their public key. At this point, the two people know absolutely nothing about one another, as they are registered with laundered keys that cannot be traced to the previous month's event. They then do the video event, and after, they reveal their committed video + public key.\n\nA bit like a \"hash lock\" but with video. I have considered similar ideas over past 5 years, and wanted to mention it here if anyone is interested.\n\n***On the \"but AI\" issue:*** *1-on-1 video chat is the most secure \"digital Turing test\" there is. Of course, a hypothetical science fiction technological singularity would break it but then such a system could grow a retina more easily or probably build replica androids indistinguishable from people too so at that point most proof-of-unique-human systems collapse anyway - I only mention this science fiction scenario as some people here believe it is already real, and those people typically tend to believe the neuron-transistor analogy, that biology settled for transistors that are 10000x the diameter of our technological ones and that Moore's law somehow did not apply in biology, but I do not think that is a reasonable assumption at all. Rather the transistor is probably protein-scale, like tubulin which is 4.5x8 nm. I love AI, use it all the time and have been very interested in it since Watson won Jeopardy in 2011.*", "content_size_bytes": 2585}

After so many years in crypto, I’ve seen the scams, the hype, the empty tokens - and I get why you need to protect the community. Without some kind of filter, the noise would drown everything else out.\n\nThat said, I also believe Ethereum only stays relevant if people actually build on it. And if nobody ever gets to show what they’re building, it gets kind of hard to stay motivated. I’ve seen a few posts recently where people shared something they built (not in a spammy way), and it made me wonder: what’s the actual boundary here?\n\nWe’ve built something we really believe adds value - no token, no “financial incentives”, just a product solving a very real-world problem. Fully onchain, source-available, audited, self-custody - the kind of thing Ethereum was made for.\n\nWe’re not looking to farm attention or sell anything. We’d just love to be able to show the community what’s possible with Ethereum today - and maybe get a bit of feedback too.\n\nSo, my question is: how is Rule 9 applied in practice? Is there any room for honest builders to share what they’ve created, as long as it’s not marketing fluff?\n\nIf not, I’ll fully respect that. Just thought it was worth asking.\n\nThanks for keeping this place clean and thoughtful - I know that’s not easy.\n\n\\- someone who still believes in building", "content_size_bytes": 1499}

The goal is to enhance efficiency and trust in the network.\n\n**What's mechanism?**\n\nEIP-7732 separates block validation into two parts:\n\n* Consensus validation (by proposers)\n* Execution validation (by builders)\n\nBlock validation now happens in two steps: proposers check network rules first, then builders provide and verify the full transaction data.\n\n**Why is this needed?**\n\nToday, most Ethereum validators outsource block construction to third-party builders via a trusted relay. This introduces risks as:\n\n• Trust assumptions.  \n• Higher latency.  \n• Missed attestations.\n\n**How does it work?**\n\nInstead of including a full execution payload, proposers include a signed commitment from a builder.\n\nLater, the builder must reveal the actual payload matching that commitment.\n\nProposers get paid if the builder behaves correctly, even if they don’t trust each other.\n\n**What’s this Payload Timeliness Committee?**\n\nA subset of validators now checks whether builders revealed their promised payloads on time.\n\nThey don’t need to check the payload’s validity, just that the right data showed up when expected.\n\nThis offloads critical work away from attestations.\n\n**Benefits of EIP-7732:**\n\n• Improved security.  \n• Greater efficiency and speed.  \n• Enhanced reliability.  \n• Better scalability.\n\n**Any changes to the Execution Layer?**\n\nNope, this EIP is purely at the consensus level.\n\nThis proposal is a foundational step toward a modular Ethereum and it’s a reflection of network's commitment to long-term reliability and trustlessness.\n\n**If you looking for a reliable way to delegate your ETH**, with proven performance and consistent dependability, **Everstake** is a staking solution you can count on.", "content_size_bytes": 2135}

For the past 20 years, most modern systems use what I call \"2-phase commit that cancels on timeout\". Ryan Fugger was an early pioneer of such systems, and he always planned for to solve a problem the protocol had (he planned to make the penalty \"chunked\") but this was not possible to achieve without causing new problems. I managed to \"transcend\" that problem with the 3-phase commit I describe in the linked video.\n\nWith multihop payments perfected, Ethereum Raiden would be practical, as would Interledger or anything else (I am mostly interested in trust-backed multihop as what Ryan described 20 years ago already, but also good that Lightning Network or anything else could take off).", "content_size_bytes": 1183}

I didn't ship a dApp. I don't code.  I learned to program in LISP at university, which has given me a phobia of unclosed parentheticals but not much in the way of practical relevance.\n\nFor reasons that I don't think I can adequately explain, I decided that I wanted to take part in a hackathon *anyway*. I figured I'd spend 48 hours writing weird, Ethereum-aligned fiction. I even created KPIs:\n\n* One completed story I was proud of\n* One person telling me that they liked it\n* One moment where I felt like I belonged.\n\nI submitted a Taikai application that made my plan extremely clear. Four days later, I was accepted, along with a flight from ETHPrague and the promise of free food during the build. I took this to mean they understood and approved of my plan.\n\nThis was my first mistake.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k046l94rkt9f1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=51d38dac12e1a068c6cddea6762eac633547df3e\n\nI spent most of the two days and nights surrounded by unnervingly clever young men and women working in intense little teams, competing for €60,000 in bounties. I didn't want a bounty. I just wanted to finish something that I could share; partly for professional pride, mostly because I'd staked 0.05 ETH for a wristband and a place at the table, which would only be returned if I submitted a valid project. \n\n*Valid* was doing a lot of heavy lifting, here.\n\nI wrote directly into a GitHub repository, every thought committed in real-time to prove that the stories were conceived and written during the event. I lived on the (surprisingly good) conference buffet.\n\nI stayed at the venue until midnight the first night and got up again at 4am; my anxiety-driven insomnia finally useful.\n\nI challenged myself to include the Hackathon bounty givers, tagging them on my project notes. No one noticed. Still, I had great fun tucking a story into iExec code templates about a guy writing a heartbroken letter to his ex, passively-aggressively formatted as software. I called it *Breakup as a Service*. I spent a ludicrous amount of time formatting the code to look just right, even though it didn't do anything.\n\nAnother was an intentionally ridiculous letter written by a Hackathon participant who's absolutely certain that cleaning whiteboards and offering positive energy makes them integral to a team that hasn't noticed them.\n\n>To: The Belgrade Judging Committee  \nSubject: Prize Distribution Appeal  \nI am submitting this formal appeal to be retroactively included as a member of Team *Rebase And Chill*. While I was not listed as an official team member, I am assuming that the omission was administrative, not intentional.\n\nIt was very meta. But to complete the hackathon, I didn't just need to submit a project; I needed to present a five-minute pitch of my product. My pitch, I decided, would be to read this story aloud. I've done a lot of readings and I was pretty sure the story would take about four minutes, leaving me one minute to introduce myself and explain what I was doing. If I spoke quickly, I might even get ten seconds on the importance of fiction in tech. But this is shoved into the pile of things to worry about after I've submitted my project.\n\nBy the evening of the second day, the other teams were in tense discussions to get their apps working and filming polished demo videos in odd corners of the Sava Centar.\n\nI created a pretty PDF of five stories that I decided were complete, another word doing some very heavy lifting, and wasted two hours making a pretty cover. At the last minute, I included a page of completely pointless project metrics.\n\n* Stories finished: 5\n* Words written: \\~9,000\n* Useful words extracted: 2,607\n* Existential crises: 2.5\n* Coffee: insufficient\n* Steps (mostly pacing around the Sava Centar): 23,248\n* Meaningful glances from judges: 3 (estimated, unreliable)\n* GitHub commits: 71\n* Commits containing profanity: 3\n* Hackathon backers mentioned: 5/9\n\nThat night, I discovered that the demo video wasn't optional: it was a requirement for getting my stake back. I retreated to my accommodation, sleep-deprived and muttering. After a few hours of fitful rest, I made a loom video of the PDF with a voice-over that sounded like I was slowly disintegrating.\n\nI submitted it with fifteen minutes to spare.\n\nThis was about the time that Taikai crashed, which I'm choosing to believe wasn't personal. It sounded like the conference center was chaos so I stayed in my room. I was supposed to pitch this thing, like a real product. I needed an introductory statement. I needed to rehearse reading the story. I probably should've made PowerPoint slides but there was definitely no time for that. Somehow, I had to explain my art to a crowd who were expecting to check if my code would compile.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cq4yxmn3lt9f1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8818ce118cc7c880c001bca90b5501af4034186a\n\nThe easy first step was to practice my story so that I would know how long it took to read. Before I began, I glanced at the official Discord channel. My heart sank. The pitch sessions would start an hour after submission deadline, it said. I’d already blown half of that on spiraling. Someone posted a spreadsheet with all the teams. I was 7th. I grabbed my stuff and ran to the Sava Centar, arriving at five past.\n\nThe spreadsheet showed team number three as “in the room”, which I took to mean pitching, giving me twenty glorious minutes to grab a pastry and cobble together an intro. But then the status line vanished. I abandoned the coffee queue and marched up to the desk in front of the conference hall to ask how I’d know when it was me.\n\n[Photo by SimonaSerban.eth](https://preview.redd.it/w8uoywb6lt9f1.jpg?width=482&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=29582e2f927da349bae978fa91de390b39d5ae97)\n\nThey scanned the spreadsheet and told me I should just go in and wait  my turn. Right. No pastry. No coffee. No prep. But at least I’d get to  hear other people’s pitches and work out what I was supposedly meant to  be doing.\n\nI walked in to find clusters of people all over the  room. Some were sitting at small tables facing the wall. A small crowd  huddled near the stage; I assumed they were the team currently pitching. Someone tapped me on the shoulder and whispered the format: I had five minutes to speak. She’d wave when my time was up so that we could have three  minutes for the Q&A. I nodded and asked in a whisper where I should  sit. She pointed to a table where two men were engrossed in their  laptops. There wasn’t much room but I sat down across from them, pulling  out my notebook. I settled in. I smiled politely at the two men across  from me. One, a friendly looking man with a thick beard, smiled back.  The other never looked up. I leafed through my scribbled pages and began  rooting around in my pockets for my pen.\n\nAbout ninety seconds passed before the friendly one with the beard looked at me and spoke at full volume, as if we weren’t in a room full of people nervously  pitching their projects.\n\n“So,” he said.\n\n*Rude*, I thought.\n\nA brief pause and he continued. “Do you want to start?”\n\nI blinked and then froze in horror. “Is this my pitch session?”\n\nBoth stared at me and nodded. Yes. Yes, it was.\n\nI  opened my mouth and closed it again, hoping the floor might swallow me  whole. I mumbled something incoherent about fiction before closing my  mouth again firmly. FriendlyBeardGuy asked me if I had a Github repo. I  did! I spelled out t-w-e-l-v-e-m-e-a-t-b-a-l-l-s and they each pulled up my repository on their laptops and began rummaging through my files. That flicker of relief vanished: This was exactly the wrong place to start.\n\nI tried to explain that the repo was full of stories. They looked up from their laptops and then down again.\n\nMr Serious broke the silence. “So you have no code?”\n\nA tiny shake of my head.\n\n“Is there an app?”\n\nAnother tiny shake.\n\nHe  glanced at his screen, as if retracing the steps that had led him here.  He looked like a man who’d arrived at the wrong meeting, the wrong  building, possibly the wrong profession, but was too polite to say “What  the hell is this?”\n\nI stared at the floor as I explained that I was going to read them a story.\n\nHeavy silence, as if I were a cat offering them a dead bird.\n\nI  fumbled for my phone to find the file, which I had not yet actually ever read aloud. I tripped over the title like it was a loose paving  stone. Both men stared at my repo as if a user manual might appear.\n\nI took a deep breath and read the next line, where the story was  addressed to the judging committee. FriendlyBeardGuy looked up, puzzled. Was I talking to him?\n\nAt least he was listening. I kept going, half hoping the floor would reconsider.\n\nAs  I got to the bit about the participant wiping the whiteboard that no  one had used, Mr Serious glitched, his face shifting into something that  might have been a smile. That tiny spark was all I needed. I kept  reading, my confidence growing. The woman from the start walked over,  hovering behind the men. She held out a flat hand, lifting it up and  down. I stopped, stared at her in confusion. She made a wavey motion.\n\nOh *shit.*  I was reading competently, finally, which meant that I was using a public reading voice for an easily-distractable audience. My mother would have called it my outdoor voice;  meanwhile other people were in there doing their own  pitches, probably wondering what the hell was wrong with me. “I’m so, so sorry,” I said. “I didn’t mean to be so loud.”\n\n“No, no,” she said, looking almost as confused as my judges. “Just your five minutes are up.”\n\n*That’s it*?  I looked at her and then at the men. This was the signal for the three-minute Q&A, a nightmare from which I might never recover.  Maybe one of the questions would be “How does the story end?”\n\nFriendlyBeardGuy  smiled at me the way you smile at someone having a psychotic episode  and said, “Don’t worry” in a soothing voice. I took this to mean I  should keep reading. Somehow, I made it to the end of the story. “Thank  you,” I said in a gravelly voice.\n\nBoth of them stared at the middle distance without a word. I could only have made this worse by offering to tell the whole story in interpretive dance. The floor  beneath me remained disappointingly solid.\n\nMr Serious lifted his laptop and turned it towards me, showing me my repo. “I found code,” he said.\n\n*Breakup as a Service*  glowed on the screen. I gritted my teeth and attempted to speak through  them. “It’s a story about a guy who is trying to use code templates to  write software but he’s lying to himself and really just writing to his  ex-girlfriend.”\n\nThis did not help to clear things up.\n\n[Excerpt from Breakup as a Service](https://preview.redd.it/gjmnvjeclt9f1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=38404e4ac88a82e1779a487b449da2565a37a9f5)\n\nHe scrolled through the file. “So, this won’t run?”\n\n“No.”  Right now, this was the only thing that I was confident on. “It’s pure  vibe coding. I wrote it with AI. I showed it to a dev friend to check  the syntax but he refused.”\n\nFriendlyBeardGuy nodded in sympathy with my unknown friend.\n\n”There’s  a PDF,” I said. “Of all the stories. That’s probably easier to read  than the Github repo.” They both nodded pleasantly. They were never  going to read the PDF.\n\n”That was a very enjoyable story to hear,” said FriendlyBeardGuy. We were finished.\n\nI stumbled out and started laughing. Someone turned to stare, but after the last ten minutes, it barely even registered.\n\nIt was over. At least for me.\n\nMr Serious was probably still staring at my code, hoping it would eventually explain itself.\n\nIn that regard, he and I had a lot in common.\n\n\\---\n\nThis one's a bonus article, because I love you.

Everything felt new; no seed phrase, just facial biometrics, and something I recently heard of called MPC/key-splitting. It sounded risky at first honestly, but it worked smoothly lol. Even the recovery process on a new device. Still, I’m wary because of others saying it's unnecessary and risky. But, so far, for me, it’s super user-friendly, yet is it truly safe?\n\nI'm just curious and looking for honest feedback/s.

This was my first Ethereum event, and I wasn’t sure what to expect.  A security guard stood ramrod straight in front of an ETHPrague banner, like the hall needed protecting from unknown hordes. He glanced at my wrist dismissively and pointed at the next building.\n\nThere, things looked a bit more hopeful. A woman stood behind a make-shift counter,  radiating the excitement of a first-time substitute teacher determined not to mess up.\n\n\"Hi,\" I said. \"I'm Twelve Meatballs.\"\n\nShe looked at me. I looked at her.\n\nShe broke first. \"I need your ticket.\"\n\nOf course she did. I pulled out my phone, flustered.\n\n\"Are you--\" She paused, swallowing the word *lost*.  \"...here for ETHPrague?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, poking frantically at my phone.\n\n\"It's a QR code,\" she told me. She was on the verge of explaining to me what a QR code was when I finally found my ticket. She scanned it, relieved that the issue had been so easily resolved. Then, almost as an afterthought, she handed me a paper bag of goodies: plastic battery pack, postcard, and a small bottle of what looked like soy sauce. \"It's an energy drink,\" she told me helpfully.\n\nI slipped into my first session, sitting in the back like I was afraid someone was going to give me detention. \"Prove you are human,\" said the man on the small podium and for a moment, I wasn't sure I could.\n\n(I'll link the talks as I go so you can consider which ones are worth watching.)\n\nThat was [Rémi introducing Self Protocol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFUHuN0g5ls); at that point, I had no idea that I was [going to end up obsessing about their proof of humanity](https://twelvemeatballs.com/coverage/proof-of-humanity/). Next, Mely.eth talked about the shift from domains to usernames and how [ENS can solve the centralization of our online identities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHtROWyI-oo).\n\nThe morning had barely started and already my brain was full.\n\nI slipped out as unobtrusively as I could and returned to the security guard. \"I'm just wondering if there's anywhere here to get coffee.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't know,\" he said. \"But there's this thing called Google Maps.\"\n\nChastened, I turned to walk away. \"Right. Thanks.\"\n\n\"No, wait.\" He pulled out his phone. \"I'm just looking.\" He hadn't been telling me off, just thinking out loud.\n\nI smiled and glanced at his nametag. It said ShieldTech.\n\n\"OK, I found something,\" said ShieldTech. Coffee was available at the opposite side of the market but he didn't like the route Google offered. \"Don't do that. Just go straight this way and turn left. It's called....\" He struggled to translate the name. \"I think Coffee King.\"\n\nI did not need the name of the coffee place and especially not in English. \"Thank you very much,\" I called over my shoulder, escaping back into the hall before he could be any more helpful.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hsfncxj8ba9f1.jpg?width=2618&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=14f3a5e1c07c856f0810c7f3e30fe1e557d37300\n\nIn the main presentation room, [Anthurine Xiang introduced EIP-7907](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzEY0_6EL44) in a fantastically relatable manner, using Uber as an analogy: surely you wouldn't want your driver to pay a flat rate, regardless of the distance of your trip. But at the same time, you wanted to know how much you were likely to pay before you got in the car. I'm not saying I *understood* EIP-7907 but at least I was starting to grasp what was at stake.\n\nUnfortunately, this seemed to mark the limit of my ability to take in new information. I wandered into [mf's talk on the new Cypherpunk generation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqTLKi1mZ40) hoping for something revolutionary. I left mostly thinking about lunch.\n\nI made my way to a coffee stall that may or may not have been called Coffee King. \"Do you speak English?\"\n\nHe rolled his eyes. \"What do you want?\"\n\nI relaxed. This was much more the level of service I expected in Eastern Europe. I ordered a caffé latte, \"just a single shot,\" I told him. I needed to pace myself for the soy sauce drink later. He rolled his eyes and handed me a milky coffee. Fortified, I returned to the conference.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q18xij5aba9f1.jpg?width=2618&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b4fdf494ce6ca747cbdf8deec3a9efc8e5fd87f8\n\nThe highlight of my day was [Tomasz Stańczak's fireside chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUADTUaXoDs&t=6s). Someone behind me was muttering about Layer 2s capturing all of the value and Stańczak responded as if he'd heard the man, explaining that the first focus had to be the growth of the network.  \"This is not the time to imagine that Ethereum has to focus on collecting fees from L2s.\" Instead, he suggested that we want L2s to keep winning and expanding.  Our biggest challenge right now, he said, was the courage to change things and the courage to explore.\n\nIf there was an official Ethereum anthem, I would have been humming it.\n\nAndrew Koller of Kraken's talk [on onboarding users, not just holders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2C92EZ5KK_U) shocked me with the stat that only 20% of users bother to withdraw funds from Kraken; the majority are holders, not users, and he wants to change this.  From there, I accidentally sat in on [Gavin Wood’s talk on Jam and CoreVM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWkytppv8Ns): I understood maybe 3% of it, but the parts I *did* catch were fascinating.\n\nThat was the pattern: sharp edges of clarity inside long stretches of blur. [Mariia Yaatskovska on CoW swaps solver competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzlkHTZHi6M), [DCBuilder on the trust issues of client-side proving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOi-zAXReNE&pp=0gcJCdQJAYcqIYzv) and [Tomas Studenik on what happens if we lose power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7EKLow08Fw) all had good and accessible talks.\n\nI ended the day with [the panel on Ethereum Privacy Roadmap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5iMds9_s90), which became [the first of my articles about the conference](https://twelvemeatballs.com/coverage/ethprague-we-are-larping-at-privacy/).\n\nI have to admit that I was relieved that the content for the day was over. By the end, I didn't even have enough energy to keep saying hello to ShieldTech, who kept staring sternly ahead as if I might be a fatal distraction to his role as our protector. I found a restaurant near my hostel and collapsed into a platter of Schnitzel to consider my thoughts.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7oj0p9beba9f1.jpg?width=3321&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d2bdda49229f07a4b5b9b3084f333806a218a169\n\nI'd  worried that the conference would be too technical, aimed at devs and genius mathematicians and not relevant or even comprehensible to me. And sure, there was technical content but there was also plenty for an outsider like me to engage with. Not just plenty, too much to even keep up with.\n\n\\~o\\~\n\nIt was raining as I arrived for Day Two.  ShieldTech waved me over. \"I have new information,\" he told me. \"If you want coffee, you just go into that hall there. The one marked as...\" He paused, possibly counting in English in his head. \"Seventeen. That is where you should go to get coffee.\" I had the feeling he'd spoken more English today than in the previous three years.\n\n\"No problem,\" he said, and went back to watching people's wrists to make sure they had their wristbands.\n\nI fingered my mystery soy sauce bottle and went straight to the presentation rooms.\n\nSomehow, the day-two schedule was even better than the first.  I started with [Katarzyna Kiwalska's lament](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0slXeRXe-2g) that companies seem to always be waiting for the right moment to start worrying about sustainability.  Dr. Maurice Chiodo amused us with his consulting work on [AI projects seriously lacking in common sense](https://youtu.be/46prZzUxa8Q?si=09zVXk6rqNszD7J7), let alone ethics.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/63lvb2fhba9f1.jpg?width=2795&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d59cfe35225cdaad1ed74b797906d88ed33d4c3c\n\nThe first fireside talk of the day was [Aya Miyaguchi and Christopher Fabian](https://youtu.be/GSQg2yccM_4?si=gFeq921kyBay4f1O) talking about the Ethereum Foundation and working with UNICEF (my favorite anecdote: Aya trying to surreptitiously text Vitalik under the table to say \"I think this guy is serious\"  while Chris thought that maybe she was just really bored of him). This was followed by the headlining fireside chat with Vitalik Buterin and Tim Berners-Lee (ETHPrague have not released this video but you can read my take: [Dreams of Decentralization](https://twelvemeatballs.com/coverage/dreams-of-decentralization/)).\n\nAfter that line-up, I retreated to the open courtyard, where thankfully it had stopped raining. I made the mistake of checking X to see a viral post: \"So is there *anyone* in crypto who's over 30?\" The online discourse seems to constantly reinforce that the crypto-verse is overwhelmingly white, male, and above all young. At ETHPrague, it couldn't have been more off-base. Sure, two baby-faced boys of dubious hygiene sat at the table behind me, arguing about serious hackathon stuff.  But at the same time, a couple in their 60s walked past, talking animatedly, dressed like they'd just stepped out of a Milan showroom. I could hear at least four languages being spoken from a range of men and women\n\nThe space wasn't *just* young and it definitely wasn't just male. Admittedly, the two hackers definitely needed proof of being over 18 but no one questioned their right to be there. Or mine.\n\nAnd honestly, that felt pretty great.\n\nI returned to the fray with a quick smile at ShieldTech, who had gone back to pretending that he'd never seen me before.\n\nI was ready for the next firehose of information. Sara Polak cracked us up between hard facts about [archaeology and how blockchain could make a difference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3Je2snOPVc). Paul Brody injected us with raw hopium as he talked about [enterprise use of stablecoins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NivgjKN1NX0). [Joachim Schwerin from DG GROW of the European Commission](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGwm53kO44A) nailed the need for anonymity, calling out the huge systemic risks in legacy capital systems.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bam9y1fjba9f1.jpg?width=2869&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1bbc907eb9d776bacb88464ffcf6023453c59041\n\nMy biggest challenge wasn't going to be searching for three presentations to write about...but picking *only* three.\n\nThe only downside was that the whole thing felt wildly unmoderated. There were “hosts,” not moderators. No one was managing the time, so talks ran over, questions rambled, and transitions didn’t really exist. In ROOT, I heard one host say “Hey, you don’t have to leave,” as half the room quietly did. The problem was that there was no break to change tracks: if you didn't walk out, you missed the beginning of the next interesting talk or worse, got caught up in an audience member's monologue of \"not a question but more of a comment\".\n\nStill, it was a great day and I was overflowing with ideas and cross connections. And on top of everything else, when I left, ShieldTech almost smiled at me.\n\nI had thousands of words of notes. It took two beers to stop my brain from spinning and a glass of wine to get it spinning in the other direction.\n\n\\~o\\~\n\nSomehow, the third day, I convinced myself that not only could I take in another day of conference presentations but that I could attend *two conferences at once*. This was the final day of ETHPrague but also the only day of ETHGlobal Pragma, situated in another hall about five minutes away.\n\nThis time, I registered at the ETHGlobal tent without any confusion or weird explanations. Although, I also did not receive any mystery soy sauce bottles, so I might need to rethink that approach.\n\nBack at Hall 13, ShieldTech *definitely* smiled at me. Then he saw that I was wearing the wrong wristband.  I said something about the other conference but he just shook his head and looked away. I felt like I'd just been caught cheating.\n\nETHGlobal Pragma felt like a tech conference dressed up for its first job interview: champagne instead of Red Bull, tasteful music, photographers everywhere, waiters bustling through to pick up abandoned plates of canapes. The caffé latte came with meticulous foam art. Hipster devs and first-time hackathon attendees looked equally uneasy as they stood at the cloth-covered tables. Someone nodded hello to me and I spilled my coffee in surprise. It was day three: was I... a veteran?\n\nSome of the same speakers were at ETHGlobal Pragma as at ETHPrague but they were just as good the second time around. Tomasz Stanczak spoke eloquently in more detail about [Ethereum's long-term vision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacHN851czA). [Martin Derka and his cats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYM92J7kgPE) talked about Intelligent Sequencers which sounds dull but definitely wasn't. (My notes just say, \"F\\*ck me, I think I understand Zircuit\" but this may have just been a fever dream.)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d3j7352mba9f1.jpg?width=3308&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1643d20d91dbae1bc589832b3687f1bb9662a5d4\n\nI returned to the ETHPrague halls, putting the relevant armband on the other wrist like I was advertising my poly status. ShieldTech nodded approvingly and let me in.\n\nI had arranged to meet an online friend for lunch, except that I was too hyped up to eat and instead offloaded conference braindumps on the poor man. You know who you are...Sorry, but it did help!  After that much needed debrief, I was wow'd by [Aleksejs Ivashuk's talk on what happens if your government says you don't exist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcFA6EsnTms), which led directly to my [querying Self Protocol's solution](https://twelvemeatballs.com/coverage/proof-of-humanity/).\n\nI wandered back to ETHGlobal Pragma  ~~for more canapes~~  to watch Chris Hobcroft talking about what Ethereum's *for*, but by now, I was struggling to take any new information in or even to stay awake.\n\nI wasn't quite desperate enough to try the soy sauce energy drink but luckily, Paul Brody woke me up again with his engaging talk on why [privacy is critical for business adoption](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacHN851czA&list=PLXzKMXK2aHh7vLS72NelQ2dOx2VgPNxJZ&index=3&pp=iAQB) (although I still don't understand why he is passionately against TEEs).\n\nAnd then, as if in a fever dream, I realized that we were already at the finale. Vitalik's keynote was an  [amazing call to action for DAOs](https://youtu.be/4cwLvbnpWwY?si=Fo7MxwSTzSAfxqVv) to reinvent themselves so they can aim for greatness. He spoke with Kartik Talwar for an hour and fifteen minutes, until the sounds of glasses clinking for the ETHGlobal Happy Hour became overwhelming and they brought the presentation to a close.\n\n[Photograph courtesy of the ETHGlobal Pragma Flickr account](https://preview.redd.it/1mnd15ooba9f1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ea756af39e19a2fc77132ba2974b441afc9a9ed)\n\nI ended up sipping Pils next to a shark-faced man wearing a suit that cost more than my annual income. He introduced himself with a smooth smile, explaining that he was one of the ETHGlobal  sponsors. Was I taking part in the Hackathon?\n\n\"I'm a writer,\" I said, managing somehow *not* to introduce myself as Twelve Meatballs or offer weird personal details that would need serious explaining. As a result, I didn't identify myself at all, too tired and confused to attempt to be witty.  \"I'm writing about the conference.\"\n\n\"That's interesting,\" he said. \"Where can I read your work?\"\n\nI looked at him blankly. The conference was still in progress; how could I have written about it already?\n\nHis smile tightened. \"Like a website?\" He was clearly trying to be kind.  As it happens, I have four (4) websites with various types of writing on them, any one of which I could have told him about. But at that moment, this escaped me. \n\n\"I haven't written it yet,\" I said, as if I'd never written a word in my life.\n\nHe nodded and kept nodding as he moved to the next table, introducing himself with a smooth smile.\n\nI retreated to the halls of ETHPrague, where my friend ShieldTech informed me that the conference was over and everyone was leaving. After an awkward pause, he helpfully informed me that there was a rave that I could go to.\n\nAttending a Czech rave would make for a wildly amusing story but I had already experienced more than my share of failed social interactions for the day. I had at least one Gb of notes and a bottle of soy sauce in my bag that I was apparently doomed to carry around forever. That felt like enough.\n\n\\---\n\nThis completes [my series on ETHPrague](https://twelvemeatballs.com/).

You can check out our leadership team here:[ https://www.definitymarkets.com/leadership](https://www.definitymarkets.com/leadership)\n\nWe’ve spent most of our careers in foreign exchange, working at major banks like Barclays and Lloyds, helping institutions move hundreds of billions through some of the most tightly regulated markets in the world.\n\nAnd we’ve learned exactly what institutions need:\n\n**Security. Compliance. Separation of risk.**\n\nWhen crypto started to mature, we saw what was coming: \\*\\*Institutional capital was on the way.\\*\\*But it wasn’t going to flow through hype or tokens. And no, banks weren’t going to use MetaMask.\n\nThey were going to need infrastructure that looked like what they already trust:\n\n**Regulated. Secure. Transparent.**\n\nSo we got to work.\n\nWe spent years doing the regulatory groundwork, the hard stuff most avoid and turned it into our moat. We built DeFinity as a **non-custodial platform from day one**.\n\nWhy? Because institutions don’t want their trading venue holding their assets.\n\n**Anyone remember FTX?** They need separation of function, risk controls, and audit trails.\n\nWe integrated with Fireblocks (who are like MetaMask for institutions)  which provides secure wallet infrastructure for institutions and made onboarding possible in under four hours.\n\nWe’re not another token without utility. We’re not a DeFi experiment hoping for traction.We’re not waiting for regulators to catch up.\n\n✅ We’re serving clients\n\n✅ We’re generating revenue\n\n✅ We’re regulated, integrated, and live\n\nThis isn’t a vision. It’s a functioning product. And we’re just getting started.\n\nTo stay up to date with out latest news follow us in X [https://x.com/definitynetwork](https://x.com/definitynetwork)\n\n\n\n**TLDR:**\n\n**The problem:** Institutional capital wants into crypto but most projects fail on regulation, custody, or compliance.\n\n**The solution:** DeFinity Markets provides regulated, non-custodial infrastructure with full Fireblocks integration.\n\n**The proof:**\n\n– Fully doxxed team with decades of FX & TradFi experience\n\n– Years spent securing regulatory approvals\n\n– Onboarding in under 4 hours – Real clients.

You can't re-create the almost decade long distribution of the old PoW coins (Zcash, Monero, Litecoin). It's impressive that Zcash continues to push out the best privacy tech in the space.\n\n---\n\n📄 [Original Article](https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/06/04/crypto-without-privacy-isnt-crypto)\n\n> Privacy is the soul of crypto, and without it, nothing else we’re doing really matters.\n> If you care about financial sovereignty, you need privacy. If you care about coordinating with others to effect social change, or thinking freely, or building a more prosperous society, you need the free exchange of value. Freedom begins with privacy.\n>\n> As engineers and scientists working on Zcash, we have spent years developing private financial tools that will be embedded into the future of civilization. It is no exaggeration to say that our descendants will either live in a world that rests upon the foundations that we are building today, or else live in a world that we neglected.\n>\n> Zcash was the first cryptocurrency to ship real, strong privacy with zero-knowledge proofs. Solving the privacy problem with cryptography was only the first step: we needed to quickly iterate and improve our cryptography so that it was practical to run on phones, and invest heavily into research that would make it possible to scale. Today, our innovations sit at the heart of many decentralized protocols.\n>\n> But while the path forward for scaling private on-chain payments is now straightforward, no project has addressed the fundamental challenge of scaling private wallets at the same time.\n>\n> Most users of cryptocurrencies will use wallet software that relies on a remote server to enable sending and receiving payments. This helps address scaling problems by pushing bandwidth and computational burdens away from users’ devices, but comes at the cost of requiring the user to relinquish their privacy to remote services.\n>\n> To make our privacy-preserving monetary project a reality we need a user experience that is just as convenient as one that has no privacy at all.\n>\n> The simplest solution is to use exotic cryptography to enable remote servers to assist our local wallet software without revealing any private information. We’ve known that this is theoretically possible, but until recently it seemed to be impractical at scale — at least a decade of new science away, or so we thought.\n>\n> Enter Project Tachyon. With existing cryptography and some clever protocol adjustments, it is completely practical for Zcash’s wallet software to synchronize with a highly active blockchain full of transactions by outsourcing the expensive parts to untrusted third-party servers. The servers don’t learn anything about your wallet and cannot even tell which on-chain transactions correspond with their users.\n>\n> To be sure, the cryptography needed to make this possible and scalable is still not simple. Fortunately, Zcash has a long track record of building and shipping this exact kind of advanced cryptography. We’ve already set the stage for it in some of our recent upgrades, and with Project Tachyon we plan to make rapid progress deploying the remaining changes over the next year.\n>\n> I’m excited that we have such strong enthusiasm and alignment in the Zcash community to make it a reality. But I’m also relieved that we can meet the moment and actually build highly scalable, unstoppable digital money. We don’t have time to wait for any more research or scientific advances. Fortunately, with Tachyon, we can build and deliver today.", "content_size_bytes": 3675}

Total blockchain activity hit a new record. Over 342 million transactions happened in just seven days. That’s the highest weekly number I’ve come across so far.  \n  \nSolana, BNB Chain, and Tron led the activity. Solana especially stood out. It alone handled almost 60 percent of all transactions. That spike didn’t just happen out of nowhere. A lot of it came from meme coins launching non-stop on Solana platforms like LetsBonk and Pumpfun. These tokens are highly speculative but they’re pulling in a ton of new users. The chain has been nonstop busy.  \n  \nBNB Chain had a smaller slice of the volume, around 19 percent, but it still has the most applications built on it. It covers everything from DeFi to gaming to NFTs and that mix helps keep users active and money flowing. It also got a recent speed boost after the Maxwell upgrade, which reduced block time to around 0.75 seconds. It’s smoother now and feels more responsive.  \n  \nSolana, BNB Chain, and Tron are also still among the most used chains daily. Tron even passed Ethereum in daily USDT volume. It’s mostly large whale trades plus over a million smaller retail transactions happening every day. That kind of consistent flow shows that these chains actually have real communities using them.  \n  \nSure, some of this spike is probably driven by speculation and hype but even with that, 342 million transactions in one week is a serious number. It shows more people are actively using blockchains rather than just watching from the sidelines.  \n  \nFeels like something is starting to build again in the market.

The weather was fine, and the daily APY was thicc! the scams and rug pulls were there, but a lot more thought had gone into these projects. Ahhh OHM, TIME, STRONG.. take me back! Around 17,000 Alt coins existed back in those days (meaningful) with many of them dead. Liquidity was juicy after the COVID crash and the choice of alts to invest in MUCH smaller. Alts would pump 10x in a few hours. Launchpads were the real alpha and APY plays made you feel like you were really about to retire in a few weeks! Alas for many, it was simply moving liquidity to the early adopters.\n\nFast forward. It’s July 2025, we’ve had sunshine for a week in the UK and BTC.D is looking like it’s about to make moves. Many Altcoin moonbois from 2021 are now BTC maxis having joined the halls of BTC Valhalla with the once 2017 Altcoin moonbois! \nWhat’s left, a somewhat hopeful, slightly delusional and most certainly deep in the red group of crypto bros praying a 2025 AC Szn will set them free. \n\nAt the end of 2021 around 400k tokens had been born, lived and died. By the end of 2025 it’s estimated there will have been nearly 100 million tokens created. As of today it’s believed there are hundreds of thousands of active / alive projects\n\nThink about that number, think about how much liquidity is needed to nourish hundreds of thousands of projects this Altcoin season, draining liquidity - spread thin like butter. There simply isnt enough liquidity in the market to feed the hunger of all.\n\nSadly, MANY legitimate, great projects will see no more than maybe a 1-3x top 100s may see 50% to 1x.\n\nThis fabled Alt season will be like spreading butter over the world’s largest piece of toast.\n\nI ofcourse hope you all get back to break even.

I understand the argument for bitcoin appreciation - it's won the battle for digital store of value based on it's unique origin story, fixed supply and a culture that will always enforce that limit.  But store of value seems like pretty much a winner take all category.  Much like there was really only gold as the global store of value asset for 2000 years, it's reasonable to think that there might only be bitcoin far off into the future.\n\n\n\nSo, that's bitcoin, but what about the rest of it?   What is the expectation that any other token will appreciate over the long term?  Some of them might have interesting technology or perform some use case particularly well, but how does this utility lead to long term appreciation?  As the price goes up, it will just be undercut by new entrants offering the same service at a lesser price.  Utility tokens (for lack of a better word), just feel like commodities to me.  They may go up or down over the short term as they compete against each other, but in the long run they are all going to zero (or close to it).  The only argument I see for buying any of this stuff, is just to cynically get in, hoping to exploit the greater fools and get out in time.  \n\n  \nWhat am I missing?", "content_size_bytes": 1310}

She really believed she was getting to know someone with genuine intentions, and to find out it was all a lie designed to scam her — it hit her hard. She’s upset, of course, but also incredibly thankful that she didn’t invest any money or go further. She kept saying she felt so lucky that we found out in time.\n\nWe confronted him and — surprise, surprise — he denied everything. By then, she was too hurt to keep talking, so I stepped in and told him straight: we know it’s a scam, we’ve reported both him and the site, and we’re done. (I might’ve said a little more than that… but you get the idea 😅)\n\nBut more than anything, I just wanted to say **thank you** — sincerely, deeply — to all of you who commented on my original post. Whether your replies were cautious, blunt, snarky, or kind — every single one helped open our eyes to the truth. And you helped protect someone from not just being scammed, but emotionally devastated.\n\nI know it’s easy to scroll past things online, but you didn’t. You took the time to reply, to warn us, and to care. That means more than I can express. You may not realize it, but you truly made a difference in someone’s life.\n\nWishing every single one of you good vibes, smooth days, and lots of wins — in trading, in life, and everything in between. Hope the world treats you kindly. You’re all absolute legends, and I’m so grateful for this community.\n\nThank you. 💛", "content_size_bytes": 1669}

There is NO CURRENCY that is meaningfully measured by its market cap. No one says, \"Oh, the market cap of the Japanese yen is $X trillion,\" because that's not how currencies are measured. \n\nGDP is measured, yes. But GDP is a measurement of an economy's economic activity, not a way to measure currencies. If crypto analysts were honest, they'd try to measure crypto value using GDP, but crypto analysts also know that the actual GDP of crypto -- including Bitcoin -- is probably hilariously low compared to its \"market cap\" because trading activity generally isn't included in GDP. Which is probably why you don't see references to \"the GDP of Bitcoin\" or whatnot very often, if ever.\n\nAnd people in crypto intuitively know this. You KNOW that if anyone tries to sell even 0.1% of Bitcoin, the \"market cap\" of Bitcoin will be plummet. Anyone who quotes \"market cap\" to you as a reason to feel confident in crypto is either uninformed or actively trying to deceive you.\n\n\"Market cap\" for crypto is just another way to reiterate the price, but using bigger numbers, which is especially useful for small coins.

SOL dropped from $250 down to under $10 in December 2022, then slowly climbed back to similar highs by November 2024. The pattern looks solid when you zoom out..... and the key level everyone's watching is $170. If SOL breaks above that with strong volume, the first target around $295 is totally reasonable based on how these patterns usually play out.\n\nBut here's where I need to pump the brakes on the $2,700 target. At that price, we're talking about a market cap of roughly $1.4 trillion. To put that in perspective..... Apple sits around $3.5 trillion, so we'd be talking about Solana becoming 40% the size of the world's most valuable company. Is it impossible?? No, but it would require adoption levels that are way beyond what we see today like crazy \n\nWhat I find more interesting than the price targets are the current market dynamics. Open interest in SOL futures is near all time highs, which means big money is positioning heavily. The weighted funding rate has been positive for five days straight..... which tells us that traders are literally paying premiums to hold long positions because they're so bullish.\n\nThe stablecoin supply on Solana jumped from $10.5 billion to $11.4 billion just this month, which is an 8.5% increase. When I see liquidity flowing into an ecosystem like this.  Plus that Pump fun event last week processed $448 million in token sales in 12 minutes without breaking the network..... that's genuinely impressive ( they pulled silicon valley rt) \n\nThe technical setup is solid and if SOL breaks $170 decisively, I could see $295 happening relatively quickly. Beyond that, each level becomes exponentially harder because of the market cap math. But if it fails to break $170, we could see a pullback to $136 or even $100 .\n\nThe next few weeks around that $170 level are gonna be crucial for determining if this breakout is the real potential or just another failed pattern. Even if it get to half of it , it’s huge amounts of wealth. ", "content_size_bytes": 2063}

Now, you won’t need to give your name, address, and Social Security number to make a trade on a decentralized exchange.\n\n# What was the IRS trying to do?\n\nThis all started back in 2021, when the Infrastructure Bill passed. It quietly expanded the definition of a cryptocurrency “broker” to include anyone “facilitating digital asset transfers.”\n\nThe Treasury interpreted that to include **non-custodial DeFi protocols**. They wanted decentralized apps to be subject to the same rules as Robinhood or Coinbase: collect user data, file 1099s, and report trades. Even though these apps have no way of identifying customers, and have 0 infrastructure in place to send out tax forms. \n\nIt wasn’t just impossible to implement—it would’ve fundamentally broken DeFi.\n\n# How this affects Solana DeFi\n\nIf this rule had gone into effect:\n\n* You would’ve needed to KYC to use Jupiter/Raydium and other exchange\n* These platforms would have to figure out how to send thousands of 1099 forms (it's not like they have huge compliance teams like Coinbase) \n* Every wallet you used (Phantom, Backpack, etc.) would’ve  been pulled into the compliance dragnet\n\nLuckily, because of pushback from crypto advocates the rule is now gone. According to [The Block](https://www.theblock.co/amp/post/362013/treasury-department-irs-remove-controversial-crypto-broker-tax-rule-requiring-non-custodial-service-providers-to-file-customer-transaction-info), The IRS and Treasury have officially removed the rule from the Code of Federal Regulations.\n\n# So… do I still have to pay taxes?\n\nIf the IRS is reading this: I’m totally paying my taxes on everything ;)\n\nBut seriously though, if you’re planning to move money through centralized exchanges, you should report your taxes (not that hard if you don’t have anything complex, just use CoinLedger/another crypto tax software). Remember, Coinbase/other centralized exchanges are still subject to tax reporting rules. \n\nI think the best thing about this is that any developer in their garage can spin up a decentralized app without having to worry about sending tax forms to users.\n\n**TL;DR**: Big win for crypto investors, DeFi protocols won’t be required to KYC users anymore", "content_size_bytes": 2764}

It combines a cloud-native IDE with agentic AI models trained exclusively on over 22 million lines of Solana code and more than 130,000 task-specific instructions.\n\nDevelopers can describe a program's functionality in plain English and receive a Solana program that includes account structures, instruction handlers, tests, and documentation. \n\nCodigo provides a library of templates such as token vesting, staking, swaps, NFT minting with Metaplex, compressed NFTs, and DeFi primitives like bonding curves, escrows, and lending protocols, and also features integrated static analysis and vulnerability detection. \n\nPlanned features include frontend and backend integration, performance analytics, and a one-click deployment pipeline with automated testing and verification steps.\n\n[**Codigo**](https://codigo.ai/?ref=blog.colosseum.com)\n\n# 🏆 Hackathon Playbook\n\nSuperteam Japan has released a Hackathon Playbook to help teams build high-quality projects and increase their chances of winning one of the world’s largest crypto hackathons. \n\nDeveloped from interviews with past winners, judges, and teams, the playbook outlines a proven framework tested during the recent Breakout Hackathon.\n\nThe playbook focuses on five major areas:\n\n1. **Hackathon Canvas:** Use structured tools like the *Lean Canvas* and *SAT Canvas* to clarify your problem, solution, target users, and strategic advantages early in the build process.\n2. **Pitch Deck:** Learn what makes a compelling deck, including best and worst practices, and a sample agenda for organizing your presentation effectively.\n3. **Iteration:** Emphasize continuous refinement of your product, messaging, and demo based on feedback during the hackathon timeline.\n4. **Hype Video:** Create a short, engaging teaser to generate attention from the community, judges, and potential users.\n5. **Pitch Video:** Follow a detailed checklist to structure your final pitch video. \n\nThe playbook also includes a checklist and a list of “red flag” words to avoid, based on common feedback from past judging panels.\n\nThe guide is designed to launch a startup within the constraints of a hackathon.\n\n[**Superteam Japan Hackathon Playbook**](https://superteam-japan.gitbook.io/hackathon-playbook?ref=blog.colosseum.com)\n\n# 💰 Drift Foundation Builder Fund\n\nDrift Foundation’s Builder Fund will distribute up to 100k DRIFT, with as much as 25k DRIFT per team, to accelerate mobile-first trading interfaces that execute on Drift perpetuals over Solana. \n\nAny product that routes orders to Drift qualifies, such as lightweight perps, Telegram bots, gamified views that replace price charts, or social copy-trading apps. \n\nProposals are judged on originality, team strength, and demonstrated progress. In addition to token funding, selected teams receive marketing, strategic introductions, and technical guidance.\n\nApplications are open now and close on Sept 1, 2025, and awards are issued against agreed milestones.\n\n[**Drift Foundation Builder Fund: Mobile Trading**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QflQan6UJ62BuZloG-NcbUENG247HdlJjE9DOCGdbk0/edit?tab=t.0&ref=blog.colosseum.com)\n\n# 🧮 Tokenomics Design 201\n\nThe Tokenomics Design 201 report from nonce Classic offers a detailed framework for designing, modeling, and executing a token strategy, with an emphasis on practical implementation.\n\nIt begins by defining the role of tokenomics in a project’s architecture, and describes how to plan a token’s supply structure, covering maximum supply, stakeholder allocations, and unlock mechanisms like full unlock, vesting, and emissions. \n\nThe TGE simulator (to be released soon) is a spreadsheet modeling tool that lets teams simulate and customize every major component of a token launch. \n\nUsers input parameters such as token allocations, unlock schedules, emission rates, and revenue-sharing strategies, and the simulator dynamically calculates token flows, circulating supply, and dilution over time. \n\nThe tool references real-world benchmarks from top projects, enabling teams to start with proven templates and adapt them to their specific needs. \n\nIt also includes visualizations and automatic calculations for vesting schedules, revenue triggers, and stakeholder rewards, giving founders and developers a data-driven way to design and test their tokenomics before deployment.\n\nThis guide offers a complete playbook for creating a token strategy that aligns with product goals, user incentives, and long-term sustainability. By using the simulator, teams can visualize the impact of different design choices before launch, reducing risk and increasing the chance of product-token fit.\n\n[**Tokenomics Design 201: From Theory to Execution**](https://docsend.com/view/kdmqst2b25a5rr75?ref=blog.colosseum.com)\n\n# ⚡ Quick Hits\n\n[25x Faster Anchor tests for Solana with LiteSVM (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vsOzQ1qywU&ref=blog.colosseum.com) \\- QuickNode\n\n[Pinocchio: The No-Dependency Framework for Solana Smart Contracts](https://x.com/avhidotsol/status/1941379738146427243?ref=blog.colosseum.com) \\- u/avhidotsol\n\n[Solana Launchpads Trends, Token Performance, and Platform Traction](https://x.com/ledger_top/status/1942641637261480085?ref=blog.colosseum.com) \\- u/ledger\\_top\n\n[Introducing Arcium’s $65K Developer Fellowship](https://x.com/ArciumHQ/status/1940749948125106361?ref=blog.colosseum.com) \\- u/ArciumHQ\n\n[Live with Anatoly -

In particular, it wants to explore using stablecoins to settle transactions involving tokenized real-world assets (RWA) such as digital bonds and real estate. Compared to other jurisdictions, real estate tokenization is comparatively advanced in Japan, with fairly regular issuances by real estate firms and financial institutions.\n\nPreviously Minna no Bank was involved in [stablecoin experiments](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/bank-stablecoin-gu-funding/) with two smaller Japanese banks, Tokyo Kiraboshi Financial Group and Shikoku Bank. In that case it used the Japan Open Chain blockchain, an Ethereum compatible chain with the validators comprising Japanese corporates, including the bank. The founder of the blockchain, Gu Technologies, also has a stablecoin subsidiary that conducted those trials.\n\nBy expanding from Japan Open Chain to Solana, this latest move shows institutions’ desire to engage with larger public blockchains that offer broader reach.\n\nTIS, the IT partner, is involved in other Japanese stablecoin initiatives, including partnering with Japan’s second largest bank [SMBC to explore a stablecoin](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/japanese-banking-giant-smbc-plans-avalanche-stablecoin-report/) issuance.

Unlike some other wallets, Yoroi doesn't automatically make rewards available for transactions; they remain in the stake address until you manually withdraw them.*  \n   \n*That’s why you were able to send your original staked amount of ADA without any issue — it was part of your spendable balance. But since the rest of your ADA was in rewards, you couldn’t send that portion until it was withdrawn.*  \n   \n*Because your wallet had no remaining ADA after sending out the original staked ADA, there wasn’t enough to cover the transaction fee required for withdrawing rewards. That’s why you had to send a small amount of ADA back into the wallet first.*  \n   \n*Once you did that, you were able to withdraw the rewards from your stake address into your regular wallet address, making them fully spendable.*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nHey guys,  \nI ran into a weird situation using Yoroi wallet and wondering if anyone else has experienced this or found a solid workaround.\n\nTL;DR:\n\n* I had some ADA staked and accumulated a handful of ADA as staking rewards.\n* I went to withdraw rewards, and got prompted to participate in Cardano governance \n* I chose \"Abstain\" to keep things simple.\n* I was able to successfully undelegate and withdraw the principal, but the rewards are still sitting there.\n* Now, if I click on the “Withdraw” and “Undelegate” buttons, they dont do anything , and I can’t send the rewards because they don't appear in the sendable “Assets” section.\n* So my ADA in rewards are effectively stuck \n\n# Note:\n\n* Yoroi shows the staking rewards correctly in the wallet summary.\n* I confirmed I selected an on-chain governance option (Abstain).\n* I have enough ADA in the wallet to pay fees.\n* Refreshed the app, restarted browser, no luck.\n\nAssistance appreciated!", "content_size_bytes": 2132}

Text 1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f2ih4wr0hocf1.png?width=1114&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6193b63513e20615f5153860c737f7a7867b553\n\nDate: 12 July 2025\n\nVoting Power: ₳ 206 417\n\nToday I voted on Info Action \"Tempo for Cardono Governance - Maintenance & Development Budget for 2025\"\n\nLink: [https://gov.tools/connected/governance\\_actions/495bd3cd44ea6bc0b4c2dbb1e4cdc7e214874c2c07490a4e2476a627ef911280#0](https://gov.tools/connected/governance_actions/495bd3cd44ea6bc0b4c2dbb1e4cdc7e214874c2c07490a4e2476a627ef911280#0)\n\nContext on the vote: While it's good that Tempo.vote is already an existing site, this suggested improvement doesn't look crucial for me and the budget breakdown is not detailed. Being in a market economy, we can have as many voting sites as the community would like to. But we already have Gov.tools (to be honest, at the moment I prefer this site). And it's also another way to develop such services: with the help of Cardano entrepreneurs or Project Catalyst, etc. That's why my vote is \"No\" at the moment.\n\nThat's my decision in brief. I'll be happy to hear your thoughts. See you in the next Text.\n\nBest regards,\n\nCardano DRep Cryptotexty\n\nGovTools page: [https://gov.tools/connected/drep\\_directory/drep1yqmr09530yuehxdz2wca5setx03ps5tnxxrvzlgwmk3wswugxwh](https://gov.tools/connected/drep_directory/drep1yqmr09530yuehxdz2wca5setx03ps5tnxxrvzlgwmk3wswugxwh)\n\nADA adress: addr1q8ltprg2dpuftk3xa773c4eqz62d63syevwqmeeqk75h0swy974pwpegzh7kay6pdypdedrfrunyge4fam22062a4ghq3v8jqe", "content_size_bytes": 2259}

It’s less about locking users into one system and more about enabling systems to communicate.

Do you remember your hands?\n\nNow, imagine many hands building that same piece of art, that same artifact—raising it little by little. Hands connected, collaborating, contributing—shaping something special. You know it, and we know it too: in a few years, Cardano will be obvious to a world that still thinks it's a \"niche\" solution.\n\nFor now, it’s a work in progress. And like all works in progress, it needs hands that keep moving. This time, in the Open Source project led by the Intersect Open Source Office.\n\nAn exciting paid opportunity is available to help shape and strengthen a thriving Cardano open-source ecosystem, through the Intersect Developer Advocate program. \n\nExplore the Developer Advocate program documentation and apply to it—and if someone you know has the right experience, be sure to pass it on: [https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-open-source-committee/about/open-source-office-oso/developer-advocate-program](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-open-source-committee/about/open-source-office-oso/developer-advocate-program)", "content_size_bytes": 1563}

Just to chase its meme ETF hype? You understand Pudgy will also launch another token called Abstract? Do you understand how extractive it is to have a dual token model? Even the BAYC hadn’t went that low… they stuck with ApeCoin to run their ApeChain.\n\nWhy do you think promoting something so extractive helps your brand - already living close to near extinction?\n\nThis why ppl get irritated with crypto. The higher ups have extremely bad incentive alignment with token holders. They don’t put much thought about their actions’ negative consequences.\n\nIs it because DOT like to dilute its holder base with inflation so they feel something in common with Pudgy, constantly issuing new assets?\n\nEdit 1: If you want to downvote me, at least explain your argument. Pudgy has barely anything to do with Polkadot, besides them launching one game on Mythic chain. Their Abstract Chain uses DA from Celestia and settles on Ethereum. Neither Celestia nor Ethereum official page changed their pfp to a pudgy. It just signals of desperation for any attention for DOT.\n\nEdit 2: For those who don't understand how extractive a future launch of the Abstract token on top of PENGU (Pudgy's meme), here is a nice tidbit from a crypto OG.\n\n>When an ecosystem launch a second token, the sum of both marketcap is eventually always lower than the marketcap of the genesis coin.\n\nSource: [https://x.com/lemiscate/status/1934891292464451612](https://x.com/lemiscate/status/1934891292464451612)", "content_size_bytes": 1963}

For many users, developers, and even entire projects, platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Discord, Telegram, and Reddit serve as their primary connection to the community. In the Polkadot ecosystem, where interoperability, innovation, and openness are celebrated, protecting these social accounts has become a fundamental layer of personal and project-level security.\n\n# Why Social Media Accounts Are a Prime Target\n\nThe Polkadot network is home to hundreds of parachains, tokens, governance proposals, and open-source initiatives. This level of decentralization means users rely heavily on trusted social channels to stay informed. Scammers know this.\n\nHackers target the social media accounts of reputable figures or projects in the Polkadot space for one reason: credibility. By compromising a verified or established account, a scammer can instantly reach thousands of followers who already trust the source. The most common tactics used after hijacking an account include:\n\n* Posting fake DOT giveaways\n* Promoting scam governance proposals\n* Sharing malicious links\n* Advertising fake partnerships or token drops\n* Spreading misinformation to manipulate community voting\n\nIn a blockchain environment where financial decisions often hinge on what’s shared socially, this form of social engineering can be devastating. One compromised account can result in millions of dollars in losses within hours.\n\n# How to Protect Your Accounts and Community\n\n# Enable Strong Authentication\n\n* Use 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication): Prefer app-based options like Google Authenticator or Authy over SMS.\n* Secure your email first: If your email is compromised, your social accounts are next.\n\n# Monitor for Impersonators\n\n* Search your name or project regularly: Look for clone accounts using similar profile pictures and bios.\n* Report fakes immediately: Platforms usually respond quickly to impersonation reports if enough people flag them.  \n\n# Lock Down Admin Permissions\n\n* Limit who can post: On platforms like Discord or Telegram, only trusted admins should be allowed to post announcements.\n* Use bot verification tools: This can reduce spam and protect your server or group from raids.\n\n# Educate Your Audience\n\n* Pin warnings about scams: Especially during big events like parachain auctions or governance periods.\n* Clarify your official channels: Publish a list of legitimate accounts on your project website and keep it up to date.\n\nIn Polkadot, social media doesn’t just support the ecosystem, it helps drive it. It’s where proposals are debated, partnerships are announced, and opportunities are explored. But it’s also where trust can be broken with a single bad post.\n\nWhether you’re a developer managing a parachain, a validator node operator, or simply a passionate community member, protecting your online presence is not optional, it’s mission critical. In Web3, where decentralization removes traditional gatekeepers, your social identity becomes the gate. Keep it locked.\n\nSocials:  \n[\\~X (formerly Twitter)\\~](https://x.com/DotAntiscam) |[ \\~Website\\~](https://polkadot.antiscam.team/) ", "content_size_bytes": 3357}

The process can become especially complicated if you were an early adopter who used a variety of exchanges some of which no longer operate today.\n\nAlthough certain banks advertise openness to crypto, most institutions still exercise extreme caution because of regulatory requirements and crypto’s historical links to questionable activity. In reality, the primary challenge often isn’t selling the crypto itself it’s making sure the fiat proceeds are accepted without triggering compliance issues or account freezes.\n\nA few things tend to be absolutely essential to avoid complications:\n\nMaintaining comprehensive records that detail your transaction history and show exactly how your holdings were acquired.\n\nPreparing a clear and traceable audit trail for all wallets, exchanges, and counterparties involved over time.\n\nRecognizing that internal compliance reviews can be far more intensive than many anticipate, sometimes creating friction even when front-line staff seem supportive.\n\nWithout proper preparation, it’s common for people to run into prolonged review periods, repeated demands for documents, or rejections from banks.\n\nOne issue that often gets overlooked is that older wallets sometimes carry an elevated risk rating due to past links with exchanges like BTC-e, Mt. Gox, or Cryptsy. Forensic blockchain tools (for example, Scorechain) can flag this historical exposure as high-risk, even if the funds are entirely legal and verifiable today.\n\nDisclosure: I work in this field (Swiss-regulated financial intermediary) and have helped clients navigate these challenges many times.\n\nI’m curious has anyone else had direct experience moving large holdings into traditional bank accounts?

We just assume we'll be different, we'll be the profitable ones, even though statistically 93-95% of leverage traders lose money.\n\n**Why This Actually Matters:**\n\nThere was some data published recently showing Nolus users hit $1.8M in realized PnL with <5% liquidation rates (on-chain data), and it made me realize how rare it is to see platforms actually share these numbers. Most don't want you to know because the aggregate performance is probably terrible. The truth with Nolus is that it's a platform that earns fees through open positions, and that's why it has features that protect positions from being liquidated during short/long squeezes.\n\nThink about it - traditional platforms (CEXs) often make money when you lose money. Liquidations = their revenue. If 80% of users are losing, that's not a bug, it's a feature for them. Popular decentralized platforms like Hyperliquid (which doesn't directly benefit from liquidations, I think) have traders' PnL of... -$75M! Platforms with good user outcomes will show you the data. Positive aggregate realized PnL, low liquidation rates, verifiable on-chain performance. Platforms that don't talk about this data... well, you can probably guess why.\n\nDo you actually research platform-wide user performance before using leverage protocols? Or do we all just YOLO in assuming we'll beat the odds that everyone else is facing? Because honestly, if a platform can't show me that their users are actually making money collectively, why would I expect to be any different?\n\n**P.S.** Since I mentioned Nolus, there's a campaign live at the moment. By opening a position and getting +10% PnL, you're eligible for a $25 USDC reward. Sorry for no link, but I respect the sub's rules.", "content_size_bytes": 1970}

Data is actually used. Unlike bonds that just sit idle. Its value compounds with every use case, whether in model training, analytics, or automated systems.\n\n\nIt can be tokenized with usage rights, licensing revenue, or AI utility built into the token mechanics. Yes, there are big challenges: privacy laws, valuation standards, provenance tracking. But the point is: RWAs shouldn’t just mirror the existing finance world. They should expand it.\n\n\nTokenized data could unlock an entirely new market.

The Treasury and IRS struck TD 10021 from existence after Congress passed H.J. Res. 25 in March, which the President signed on April 10, 2025, as Public Law 119-5. The Federal Register notice hitting publication today finalizes the repeal and restores section 6045 regulations to their pre TD 10021 state.\n\nWhy This Rule Mattered in the First Place TD 10021 would have fundamentally altered how DeFi operates by treating decentralized finance front-ends, payment processors, and kiosk operators as \"digital asset middlemen.\" Starting with 2027 transactions, these entities would have been forced to collect customer KYC data and issue the brand new Form 1099-DA reporting gross proceeds on digital-asset sales. Industry groups argued this was both technically unworkable and exceeded the IRS's regulatory mandate, and lawmakers ultimately agreed.\n\nThe death of TD 10021 creates an interesting division in crypto tax reporting, though the IRS can still pursue data through audits or summonses. DeFi front ends and smart contract developers dodge the immediate burden of building KYC systems and backup withholding infrastructure, but they're still on the hook for anti money laundering duties under FinCEN and OFAC. Meanwhile, centralized exchanges and hosted wallets remain firmly in the crosshairs. They must continue preparing to issue Form 1099 DA and collect basis data under TD 10000, maintaining the same timeline: gross proceeds reporting on 2025 trades with basis reporting phasing in during 2026 27. For tax professionals and software developers, this creates a strategic complexity requiring logic splits between 1099 DA ingestion for custodial data and manual entry workflows for DeFi transactions, alongside an ongoing push for better client education about self-reporting obligations.\n\nThe regulatory chess game is far from over. Stablecoin and broader crypto bills moving through Congress could reopen the entire reporting debate, while several states are considering their own digital asset information return rules that could fill the federal gap. Perhaps most significantly, expect the IRS to deploy more summonses and data-analytics audits targeting large, on chain DeFi transactions as a workaround for the missing third party reports.\n\nThis represents a nuanced victory for DeFi innovation, but the underlying tension between regulatory oversight and decentralized finance remains unresolved. The IRS will find other ways to capture this data, and states may step into the void. For now, though, DeFi maintains its operational independence while centralized crypto maintains its path toward traditional financial reporting standards.\n\n Source: [https://awaken.tax/media/article/congress-nixes-defi-broker-rule-1099da-impact](https://awaken.tax/media/article/congress-nixes-defi-broker-rule-1099da-impact)", "content_size_bytes": 2998}

There is a massive shift as these protocols mature into full-blown ecosystems, offering a much richer, more integrated experience. Think of it less like a single tool and more like an entire workshop.\n\nWhat's driving this? Well, the capabilities have exploded. Now, you can deploy your own decentralized applications right within these ecosystems, fostering a new wave of innovation. Staking, for instance, has moved past simply locking tokens for rewards; it’s now deeply tied to securing the network and giving you real governance power, letting you shape the protocol’s future. Even bridging assets across different blockchains, once a confusing and risky endeavor, is becoming remarkably smooth and intuitive, stripping away the complexity that used to deter so many.\n\nThis expansion of utility is fundamentally changing how we interact with decentralized networks. Take Tanssi Network ($TANSSI), for example. Its recent listing on Bitget caught my eye because it’s all about appchain deployment. This focus perfectly aligns with the current trend of infrastructure heavy DeFi projects. While I haven't done a deep dive yet, it clearly signals another step in this broader evolution. It’s fascinating to watch DeFi transform into something far more foundational in the crypto space  almost like the hidden engine powering the next phase of Web3.\n\nWhat deFi innovation impress you?", "content_size_bytes": 1461}

Unlike UMA which relies on optimistic validation (which by its very nature is slow), Ingex uses zk-proofs for validation. This not only results in much faster validation but greater security when nodes are attesting to events.\n\nMuch of the project is open source, and we recently launched our validator dashboard, in anticipation of our Sepolia testnet deployment. The source code is available here:\n\n[https://github.com/IngexZK/validation-dashboard](https://github.com/IngexZK/validation-dashboard)\n\n**We are already in the process of receiving backing from the Optimism Collective (one of the largest layer 2's on Ethereum) and other well-known foundations in the space.

A small set of ERC-721 tokens (NFTs) will provide passive income for holders each time an event is validated though the Ingex zk-oracle, but also give an allocation of our upcoming ERC-20 token launch.\n\nThere are only two small sets of ERC-721 tokens (and one special token) that have been launched that provide the above benefits. No more sets are launching, so it is subject to availability.\n\nThe first set has already [sold out](https://opensea.io/collection/ingex/overview).\n\nThe second set is available [here](https://opensea.io/collection/ingex-standard-eth/overview).\n\n~~There is also a 1-of-1 special token that provides the most benefits. Only *one* is available to mint. It is available [here](https://opensea.io/collection/ingex-key-contributor).~~ Edit: this has now been sold.\n\nThe three classes of tokens provide passive income at the following rates each time an event is validated through the Ingex zk-oracle:\n\n|Token Set|Revenue Share (Per Token)|Revenue Share (Set Total)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Genesis (sold out)|0.25%|8%|\n|Standard|0.18%|6%|\n|Key Contributor|2.15%|N/A|\n\nAll three provide a substantial allocation of our upcoming ERC-20 token, with the Key Contributor token in particular providing the largest.\n\nThey can can be sold at any time.\n\nHappy to answer any questions about the project here!", "content_size_bytes": 2332}

The goal is to help pro users save time and give newbies both knowledge and time when analyzing crypto projects.\n\nWhy did I build it?  \nOver the past year, I developed a standard technique for analyzing projects: gather on-chain data, collect fundamental info (what the project is building, whether there's a real market for it, roadmap, tokenomics, team, social sentiment, etc.). I tried teaching this process a few times, but it was tough - too much info, and nobody really had the time to go through it all.\n\nThen earlier this year, I had an idea: what if I built an app that fetches all the necessary data, feeds it to AI, compares it against my personal benchmarks, and generates a final report that’s easy to understand?  \nSo I did. I created [www.dyorexpert.com](http://www.dyorexpert.com) \\- it's more like an app that helps you to take smart decisions than to make money\n\n(Btw, if you want to test it, you can create a free account with 3 credits—one for wallet tracking, one for fundamental analysis, and one for on-chain analysis.

But is there demand for this?\n\nQuick explanation: imagine a social media like twitter/x where someone well-known in #movies can’t just hijack the conversation in #defi. Even if they have a million followers, their posts in other topics don’t carry extra weight. One vote from a trusted person in #defi carries more weight than 1000 likes from accounts outside that tag.\n\nThat also means bots are useless. Even if you get 1000 fake accounts to like a post, it won’t go viral unless those votes come from people with actual rep in the #topics you're posting into. So it solves fake-news, fake engagement, spam, etc\n\nOriginally, this came from a side project where I was building a decentralized reputation system just to learn more about Rust and smart contracts. I imagined something like a web3 version of Amazon seller ratings — something that can’t be faked or bought.\n\nBut after watching people create tags and vote inside the app, I realized this could actually work as a foundation for a new kind of social media platform.\n\nSo, a few questions for you:\n\n* Do you feel unfairly treated on social media? Like big accounts control all the narrative and your posts are burried beneath spam?\n* Does it bother you when celebrities talk about stuff way outside their expertise?\n* Would you value a feed that’s shaped by people with actual rep in a topic?\n* Do you think fake news and bots are a big enough problem to need a solution like this?\n* What would it take for you to move from Twitter/TikTok to something new?\n\nJust want to have an honest conversation about this. I’m not a VC. I don’t have millions to pour into an app, so the viability of this would depend entirely on the community. So I want to understand what it would actually take for people to support AND USE it. Please be honest, I dont want to waste time building something nobody will ever use.\n\nLet me know what you think, and feel free to ask me anything!\n\nNote: I have a plan to reward creators and to monetize this, but I don’t want the post to get too long. I also have a plan for web3 projects to use the platform to talk about their proejcts, but the platform will be 100% add-free, monetization would come from additional features, private communities, etc. Ask below if you want to hear more about that.\n\nExtra: You can try the reputation tracking demo I was working on here (***this is NOT promotion***, it isn't even an app yet, this is just a link to a playground for people to visually see the algorythm in action):\n\n* [https://rigfr-siaaa-aaaal-ab4fa-cai.icp0.io/tag/ICP](https://rigfr-siaaa-aaaal-ab4fa-cai.icp0.io/tag/ICP) (***this is NOT promotion***, it isn't even an app yet, this is just a link to a playground for people to visually see the algorythm in action, this url will be erased soon)\n\nAttention: The URL looks weird because it’s running fully on-chain, frontend and backend, and I haven't bothered buying a domain for a playground test. It doesn't ask for tokens, doesn't ask to connect with your wallet, and you can explore most pages without signing up, it is just a playground.

I took advantage of the boom in DeFi some years ago and focused on studying random stuff and travelling the world. Went back to DeFi about 1 year ago and got nice returns from it, just using LPs on Uniswap, Aerodrome and...Pancakeswap. Until now.\n\nSince I'm not a complete morron on it, I use multiple wallets and diversify my funds. I never interact with funny stuff too. With that being said, I put a small investment of 1k USD into a pool of ETH/USDC in PCS using the Base blockchain. Kept it running for a while and one day my position had disappeared. At first, I thought it was an Interface issue. Came back to it after 1 hour using a different browser. Still not showing. I went to basescan and my funds were still in the pool, somehow. I was not out of range. The funds were just not showing up. I thought I was just tripping so I went to work like it was just an interface issue.  \n\nAfter 5 hours, same issue. I went to basescan again to see what the heck was going on and try to manually remove my liquidity because I was getting scared. And after 15 / 20 minutes that I decided to remove it manually, my funds were transfered to another wallet. Before that, the hacker/script, collected the fees and transfered it all. Funny thing is, it was like ''i'' did the transfer to this unknown wallet. Like, wtf. \n\n  \nI don't know what I did wrong, it was a brand new wallet that I created just for this pool, never interacted with sketchy stuff. But most important, how does this hack work? Like, I had like more than 300 USDC just sitting in my wallet and it was not stolen. If he had access to my wallet, why not just take it all and leave it completly empty? Is it a script that takes advantage of the smart contract of PCS? Is it a insider of PCS? I'm dumb as fuck? Is the base blockchain shit? All of it? I don't know. If anyone had this issue before, could you enlighten me on this? \n\n  \nIm thinking of buying a different PC just for crypto and using Linux. Maybe that's a start. Don't know if necessary though.

Sounds wild, but also kinda makes sense in a world where memes drive half the internet.  \n  \nThere's also something called the Meme Vault, where long-term contributors and holders get rewarded as memes gain traction. Add in their Launchpad for spinning up new meme tokens and on-chain scoring for engagement, and it feels more like a meme-powered economy than just another shitcoin.  \n Then I saw Bitget is already doing a 50% bonus on deposits for $M. You   \n see that for memes this early. First-come, first-servey.  \n Feels like they’re trying to turn memes into measurable value. I’m not calling it the next big thing, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t intrigued. Curious if anyone else here has poked around or joined the event?", "content_size_bytes": 1214}

The accountability, shared lessons, and camaraderie made the grind less isolating and way more fun.\n\nProp firms gave me real leverage. People talk about risk/reward per trade but no one talks about the RR of funding models. Pay $300, get access to $150K. I’ve pulled over $60K from a single funded account I paid a few hundred for. That’s insane upside. Just remembernone of it matters until the payout hits your bank. Keep your journey private. Don’t brag. Don’t explain trading to people who’ll never get it. And stop searching for a magic strategy. Simple system. Tight risk. Emotional control. Execute more. Hesitate less. That’s the real edge.", "content_size_bytes": 1680}

Don’t trade. Don’t trade to make money no matter how much you need it. Don’t trade to make money no matter how broke you are. Don’t trade to make money even if you learned a thing or two. Master the market. There’s no other way to go about it. I focus a lot on psychology but that comes only when you have mastered either technicals or fundamentals to a point where you can use it to make money in the market. Trading is probabilities which everyone knows but so is every single business decision that’s taken on earth is just that those decisions take time to be seen as results and not sudden - except in trading, the results are immediate but so are the profits, so are the losses. \n\nFocus on learning. Focus on mastering. Focus on knowing the market to a level where when you look at the charts you know exactly what’s going on and you just need to find a trade. You cannot make money otherwise. Trading is probabilities right? Now, it is up to a trader to have the best chances on his side and for every single factor that you miss by not knowing - you lower your chance of making money on that trade and overall - trading. \n\nSo, the way trading actually works is finding all the factors that give the best probability in the market and mastering them. Key levels. Momentum. Price rejections. Liquidity grab. Market structure. Swap zones. SnD zones. About 7-9 different factors at play and master every single one of them. Then - trade the market only when you have 3-5 or more factors that’s on the side of your trade (sort of like confluence in a trade) so that you have the highest probability in each trade - and what happens? You’re profitable. It’s that simple and that hard to do. \n\nFocus on learning. Learning about yourself. Learning about the market. Don’t trade for money. It’s knowledge in the market and emotional regulation and a very different / sincere thought process that makes money in this game. It isn’t a business where people come together to make it happen - it’s a profession where you are the one who makes it happen hence you are somewhat the product that does “sales”. \n\nThe better you are, the better the results. The better the results, the more time you have to improve every aspect of trading and yourself. Make loads of money. Lose a little. Make even more. Continue to learn. Master yourself along the way. Money comes after you. Knowledge comes before everything. ", "content_size_bytes": 2603}

If you’ve been trading for any amount of time, I’m willing to bet you know exactly what I mean.\n\nYour setup appears. All the boxes are checked. But now you're stuck — trying to calculate position size. By the time you’ve figured it out, the move’s already gone.\n\nThat’s when I discovered the **Average True Range (ATR)**.\n\nATR does exactly what it sounds like: it measures the **average true range** of a stock — a clean, effective proxy for volatility.\n\nLet me give you two extremes:\n\n* **$AXON** has an ATR of **29.75**\n* **$SPY** has an ATR of **4.49**\n\nBoth trade at similar price levels, but AXON is about **6x more volatile**. That matters.\n\nWhy? Because a volatile stock needs **room to breathe**.\n\nLet’s say you use a $10 stop loss. That might work fine on SPY, but on AXON, it’ll likely get hit quickly — not because your setup was wrong, but because the stop didn’t match the volatility. So even if you’re risking the same 1% on a $100K account, **you’d get stopped out \\~6x faster** on AXON, on average.\n\nBut here’s where it gets interesting:  \nIf I size my stop **based on ATR** — let’s say **1.5x ATR** — I give my trade room to work **regardless of the ticker**. Now, all I need to figure out is how many shares to buy.\n\nHere’s the formula I use:\n\n    Shares = (Account Size × Risk %) / (ATR × Multiplier)\n\nExample:  \nYou have a $100K account, willing to risk 1% ($1,000), and XYZ has an ATR of $10.\n\nIf you use a 1.5x ATR stop:\n\n    Shares = 1,000 / (1.5 × 10) = 1,000 / 15 ≈ 66 shares\n\nYou’d buy 66 shares and set a $15 stop loss. Now the position is tuned to the stock’s volatility.\n\nI personally use **ThinkorSwim**, and I’ve coded a simple script that adds a label on my charts showing me the exact share count to buy. No more freezing. No more second-guessing.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e358ecllr3df1.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6301de3f9fb803a9b02930ac5010a128869a646\n\n  \n\n\n**Hope this helps someone out there avoid the same hesitation trap I ran into.**  \nHappy trading ✌️", "content_size_bytes": 2160}

I was a BE member for a year. I originally joined to learn how to trade, but they really push you to focus on the “business” side of things (aka recruiting people for commissions). I didn’t know anything about this industry, so unfortunately, I fell for it.\nThis post isn’t meant to hate on any members of the company, but y’all really need to wake up and face the truth. It IS a pyramid scheme. We can’t ignore the fact that the company thrives on recruiting people. It’s a hard pill to swallow because we’ve been conditioned and brainwashed for years to think we’re doing God’s work by offering people this “life-changing, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.”\nBut let’s be real, once I got into the “business side,” I started seeing people as potential recruits to help me rank up. We were taught to believe we were helping them, so we shouldn’t feel bad about it. As a Christian, I really believed I was doing God’s work and that’s what makes it even sadder. I was all in. I did everything my “coaches” told me to do, including paying out of pocket to attend conventions.\nAfter going to one of those conventions (basically listening to motivational speakers tell us to never stop dreaming; aka never stop recruiting), I started to feel like something was seriously off. They straight up admitted they didn’t care about trading or even understand how it works, because all the focus was on recruitment, cause that’s where the “real money” is. I instantly felt sick to my stomach.\nI’ll admit, I should’ve done my own research before joining, but they tell you not to look them up on Google because all you’ll find is negativity and people calling it a pyramid scheme. Major red flag. But I was young and naive, so I didn’t.\nTo anyone still in the company recruiting day and night, GET OUT WHILE YOU CAN. It’s so ironic how they preach about having work-life balance and “never have to clock in and out” when in reality, they’re working 24/7. The brainwashing in these MLMs is intense. They make you feel like it’s your fault if you don’t succeed.\nI still believe MLM members are victims too, and the evil ones are the ones on top of the pyramid.

I jumped from indicators to price action, to ICT, to SMC, to trend lines, thinking the next system would finally unlock it. But here’s the truth:\n\nIt was never about the strategy.\n\nIt was about how I executed it.\n\nOnce I stopped trying to guess market direction and started reacting to what’s in front of me, things changed. I mark zones. I wait for price to hit those areas. If there’s a clear rejection, I enter. If not, I don’t. No forcing. No FOMO.\n\nNow the only thing I care about?

And that is what pricelessly **distinguishes uniquely human work** from the work of any computer or robot.\n\nMeaning, we humans are indelible to and inseparable from our context as a human. Said another way: We, cannot, be perfect — especially given that we exist with a partial image of existence.\n\nWe will always be some kind of…human, with human priorities, and human faults.\n\nThe beauty of this AI takeover, disgusting as it may be to endure, is how quickly we’ve grown an **appreciation for these quirks.** Background noise in a podcast for example, is now a welcome signal of humanity. A happy little mark of the beast, if you will.\n\n**We can even use our quirky sense of reality as a faster, better Turing test.** “Strawberries” uses the letter ‘r’ 3 times by our eyes, but usually 2 times according to most AI models (and phonetics, which isn’t itself spelled phonetically but I digress).\n\n…and that, that right there - is exactly what secures our uniquely human work into the future, in alliance with AI.\n\nIts very nature to perceive with literal exactness of its own context — the simple fact it is easily confused if you say John and Jill went down the hill instead of the exact published phrasing — is **WHY we humans ultimately have complete job security.**\n\nYou need to know how to communicate as an expert in order to direct AI to generate expert results.\n\nIt can learn faster than humans, sure.

We can choose to live in a **sense of awe and appreciation for humanity when we see it** and cherish that we can **more readily recognize the love and service which went into that** creation. And be proud of ourselves for **acting out of love and service** of human creation.\n\nSaid another way: humans make typos. Humans have to pee in the middle of the livestream. Humans live in the world and the world doesn’t wait for yard work.\n\nAnd we can choose to love it, and simply focus on becoming **e**xperts on what we love in order to flourish in this age of AI — in alliance with it.\n\nStay cozy,\n\nThe Pirate Ninja Fairy Queen and White Knight Heartbreaker, herself", "content_size_bytes": 3274}

The latter seems to be much more prominent as of late. With all that said, what if I told y’all that realistic optimism is a thing?\n\nThere’s no doubt that we are in a rough spot in our nation and world history. The rise of right wing Christo-nationalism and fascism are spreading, on top of the climate crisis and various other issues we face as a species. The harsh truth is that nothing is promised in this world. People have suffered, are suffering and will continue to suffer. This may sound fucked up, but we were never entitled to have an era of hope and good feelings forever. That’s naive and anti-historical in its nature. Throughout history, there have always been prosperous eras and negative eras as history is very cyclical in nature. We’re currently in a rough spot/negative era. The reality is that progress and history are not linear. This phenomenon is exacerbated by the fact that most of the people lamenting that we are “cooked” are young and don’t have the life experience or historical background to look more objectively. That’s exactly what realistic optimism aims to do. Acknowledging the harsh reality of the situation while still providing hope that we can get out of this. A nuanced look at reality.\n\nThe best thing about all of this? We can make optimism a thing by actually working for progress, but also recognizing the grim and harsh realities that I pointed out in my previous paragraph, without losing sight of the big picture and giving into doom. That can be achieved by working for progress and better outcomes. That's the nature of realistic optimism.", "content_size_bytes": 1970}

I thought you might like it.\n\nThe **Optimist Creed** is a set of principles developed by Christian D. Larson in his 1912 book *Your Forces and How to Use Them*. It has been widely adopted by organizations like Optimist International, inspiring individuals to maintain a positive outlook and focus on personal growth and service to others. Below is the creed with an explanation of each line:\n\n# 1. Promise Yourself To be so strong that nothing can disturb your peace of mind.\n\n* **Meaning:** Develop mental resilience and inner strength. Cultivate confidence, focus on personal growth, and practice mindfulness to stay calm and centered in challenging situations.\n\n# 2. To talk health, happiness, and prosperity to every person you meet.\n\n* **Meaning:** Spread positivity through your words and actions. Encourage others with optimism and a hopeful outlook, which can uplift their spirits and yours.\n\n# 3. To make all your friends feel that there is something in them.\n\n* **Meaning:** Recognize and affirm the strengths and value of those around you. Offer genuine compliments and support to help others feel appreciated and empowered.\n\n# 4. To look at the sunny side of everything and make your optimism come true.\n\n* **Meaning:** Focus on the positive aspects of situations, even during difficulties. Use optimism as a tool to manifest hope and better outcomes in your life.\n\n# 5. To think only of the best, to work only for the best, and to expect only the best.\n\n* **Meaning:** Set high standards for yourself and maintain a constructive mindset. Pursue excellence in your goals and expect success, which can help you overcome challenges.\n\n# 6. To be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own.\n\n* **Meaning:** Celebrate others’ achievements with genuine joy and encouragement. This promotes collaboration, reduces envy, and strengthens relationships.\n\n# 7. To forget the mistakes of the past and press on to the greater achievements of the future.\n\n* **Meaning:** Let go of regrets and learn from past mistakes. Focus your energy on what you can achieve in the present and future, rather than dwelling on what went wrong.\n\n# 8. To wear a cheerful countenance at all times and give every living creature you meet a smile.\n\n* **Meaning:** A positive demeanor can inspire and comfort others. Smiling and exuding warmth helps to foster a welcoming and uplifting atmosphere.\n\n# 9. To give so much time to the improvement of yourself that you have no time to criticize others.\n\n* **Meaning:** Concentrate on personal growth and self-reflection. Avoid negativity and judgment, which can distract from your own progress and peace of mind.\n\n# 10. To be too large for worry, too noble for anger, too strong for fear, and too happy to permit the presence of trouble.\n\n* **Meaning:** Rise above negative emotions by focusing on what truly matters. Develop emotional intelligence, practice gratitude, and maintain a positive perspective even during difficulties.\n\nThis creed serves as a powerful guideline for living a fulfilling, optimistic life while inspiring kindness and growth in others.", "content_size_bytes": 3233}

All free matter, whether on planetary surfaces or in interstellar space, will have decayed, eradicating any remnants of life based in protons and chemistry, and erasing every vestige of sentience - irrespective of its physical basis. Finally, in a state cosmologists call ‘asymptopia’, the stellar corpses littering the empty universe will evaporate into a brief hailstorm of elementary particles. Atoms themselves will cease to exist. Only the implacable expansion will continue, driven by the currently inexplicable force called 'dark energy', which will keep pushing the extinguished universe deeper and deeper into an eternal and unfathomable blackness.", "content_size_bytes": 1037}

Cómo ZK permite que redes de infraestructura del mundo real (IA, computación en la nube, gaming) se construyan sobre la blockchain, creando un mercado más eficiente y justo.\n* **La Prueba de Mercado:** Analizo por qué la reciente migración de un gigante como **Aethir** (que potencia a plataformas como **CARV**) a una red ZK nativa (**Sophon**) es una señal económica y estratégica que no podemos ignorar.

Memory Storage Layer**  \n- **Type**: *Sharded, encrypted graph database* (like a blockchain + IPFS hybrid).  \n  - **Data Structure**: Each user’s memory is a Merkle DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), where nodes are encrypted \"memory blocks\" linked contextually.  \n  - **Storage Specs**:  \n    - **Per-block size**: ~10KB (compressed text + metadata).  \n    - **Throughput**: 1M blocks/sec globally (requires petabyte-scale NVMe caches).  \n    - **Encryption**: XChaCha20-Poly1305 (quantum-resistant, faster than AES).  \n\n **2. Privacy Layer**  \n- **Anonymization**:  \n  - *Monero-style ring signatures* mask which user owns which memory blocks.  \n  - *zk-SNARKs* prove \"I have a prior chat about X\" without revealing X.  \n- **Access Control**:  \n  - **Private Keys**: Hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets (like Bitcoin BIP-32), but for memory blocks.  \n  - **Biometric Fallback**: Secure enclave-backed face/fingerprint auth to recover keys.  \n\n **3. AI Inference Layer**  \n- **Context Fetching**:  \n  - When you say \"recall our convo about pizza,\" the AI sends a *zk-proof* to the network requesting matching blocks.  \n  - Only blocks you decrypt locally are fed into the model’s context window.  \n- **Hardware**:  \n  - **User Device**: Light client (e.g., M2 Ultra chip for on-device decryption).  \n  - **Server Side**: TPU clusters with *fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)* support to compute on encrypted blocks.  \n\n---\n\n**Speculative Tech Dependencies**  \n| **Component**         | **2024 Status**               | **2030 Projection**                     |  \n|-----------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|  \n| **zk-SNARK Speed**    | ~1s/proof (Groth16)         | ~10ms/proof (Plonk++ with ASICs)      |  \n| **FHE Practicality**  | 1000x slower than plaintext | Only 10x slower (TFHE optimizations)  |  \n| **Decentralized Storage** | IPFS (slow retrieval)   | *Ceramic Network* w/ sub-second latency |  \n\n---\n\n **User Flow Example**  \n1. **You**: \"Remember my pizza preference from last time?\"  \n2. **System**:  \n   - Your device sends a zk-proof asserting: *\"I have a block tagged ‘food’ signed by key X.\"*  \n   - Network returns the encrypted block (never seen by servers).  \n   - Local GPU decrypts → feeds into AI’s context: *\"Ah, you love pineapple pizza!\"*  \n\n---\n\n **Hardware Requirements**  \n#### **User Device (2030)**  \n- **Minimum**:  \n  - **CPU**: 8-core ARM v12 (with FHE accelerators).  \n  - **RAM**: 24GB LPDDR6 (for in-memory decryption).  \n  - **Storage**: 1TB optane-like NVM for block caching.  \n- **Ideal**:  \n  - **Dedicated NPU**: For zk-proof generation (~50 TOPS).  \n  - **Secure Enclave**: Apple T-series or equivalent.  \n\n **Network Infrastructure**  \n- **Memory Nodes**:  \n  - **Storage**: 100TB+ NVMe-oF (NVMe over Fabric) per node.  \n  - **Bandwidth**: 400Gbps RDMA (for low-latency block fetching).  \n- **AI Servers**:  \n  - **TPUs**: 6th-gen, optimized for FHE (hypothetical \"FHE-TPU\").  \n\n---\n\n **Challenges to Solve**  \n1. **Energy Use**: zk-proofs + FHE could spike compute needs 1000x. *Solution*: Photonic chips or reversible computing.  \n2. **Metadata Leaks**: Even encrypted, access patterns reveal info. *Solution*: *Oblivious RAM (ORAM)* techniques.  \n3. **Adoption**: Users hate managing keys. *Solution*: Social recovery (e.g., 3 friends can reset your key).  \n\n---\n\n **Why This Could Work**  \n- **User Trust**: No corporation controls your memory; you’re the custodian.  \n- **AI Utility**: Retains context across sessions *without* surveillance.  \n- **Regulatory Safe**: GDPR/CCPA-compliant by design.  \n\n---\n\n **Prototype Roadmap**  \n1. **Phase 1 (2025)**: On-device encrypted memory (Signal-style).  \n2. **Phase 2 (2027)**: zk-proofs for private context fetching.  \n3. **Phase 3 (2030)**: Fully decentralized, FHE-compatible AI.  \n\n---\n\nThis isn’t just tech—it’s a *philosophical shift* from \"AI as a service\" to \"AI as an extension of personal agency.\" The hardware *will* catch up if the demand exists.  \n", "content_size_bytes": 4338}

Not FUD, just thinking out loud. If the maximum cap for ZK drop were 50,000 tokens (which is already quite a lot), this would free up an additional 573 million $ZK tokens for the community.\n\n16,944 wallets have 50k+ $ZK tokens, and their total drop size is 1.42 billion $ZK. If we set a hard cap of 50k $ZK for these wallets, the total drop would be 847 million tokens. In this scenario, we would have 573 million free tokens left, which could be used to make 573,000 new eligible wallets with around 1,000 $ZK each, resulting in a total of 1,268,000 eligible wallets without changing any additional metrics or criteria.\n\nEven in this scenario, a hard cap of 50,000 $ZK per wallet looks like a substantial drop. The team could still include their own wallets, just doubled in number, but their value would be diluted among all eligible wallets. A total of 1.268 million eligible wallets would result in fewer dissatisfied users and less FUD around the project.\n\nIn my opinion, the fact that the maximum cap is 100k tokens is due to the team's interest", "content_size_bytes": 1084}

I’ve been there, and honestly, I thought it was game over. But it turns out, recovery isn’t always impossible.\n\n\nBackstory: One Old Wallet, No Access\n\nYears ago, like a lot of people, I jumped into Bitcoin early and made a wallet. I stored the file, saved a few coins, and forgot about it.\n\nFast forward to this year, I finally got around to checking it again, only to realize I couldn’t remember the password. At all. I had the wallet file, but every password I tried failed.\n\nI even started thinking I might’ve used a typo when I made it. Total panic mode.\n\n\nTried the DIY Route First\n\nBefore reaching out to anyone, I went the do it yourself path. Tried dozens of combinations, installed a few recovery tools, and messed around with scripts I found online.\n\nBrute force tools helped me understand the process, but they were slow, and I wasn’t sure I was doing it right. After a few weeks, I was burnt out and still locked out.\n\n\nRecovery Services? I Was Skeptical Too\n\nEventually, I started reading recovery success stories on different forums. Most of them I ignored, too many were clearly fake or vague.\n\nBut one name popped up a few times: KeychainX. People mentioned they’d been around for a while and actually delivered for some users. I didn’t rush in. I waited, read more, then finally emailed them.\n\n\nHere’s What Surprised Me\n\nNo pressure. No hard sales. They just asked for basic info, the wallet file, what kind of wallet it was, and any password guesses I could remember.\n\nThey were upfront about what they could and couldn’t do. And they made it clear: if your wallet came from someone else or is suspicious in any way, they won’t touch it.\n\nBest part? No payment unless they succeed. That alone made me feel better about trying.\n\n\nThey Cracked It For Real\n\nTook a few days, but they got in. I didn’t think it would happen. Opening that wallet and seeing the funds still there? Unreal.\n\nAfter assuming it was lost forever, it felt like a weird kind of time travel, bringing something back from my past.\n\n\nJust Sharing My Experience\n\nI’m not here to recommend or promote anyone. This is just what worked for me after exhausting every other option.\n\nIf you’re in the same situation, maybe with an old BTC or ETH wallet, it’s worth researching recovery options. Just be smart, check the history of whoever you’re dealing with, and never send money upfront.\n\nAsk questions. Be cautious. But don’t give up right away.\n\nIf anyone’s stuck or just wants to talk through recovery ideas, happy to chat.\n\nWant to learn more? KEYCHAIN.lO", "content_size_bytes": 2660}

I'd like to share an idea for a new approach to on-chain entropy and randomness, and I'd love to get your feedback. I'm hoping to find some like-minded people to discuss it with and build it together.\n\n**TL;DR:** On-chain randomness from oracles (Chainlink, etc.) is often centralized and acts like a black box. I'm proposing a dedicated L1 blockchain (appchain) designed to be a decentralized \"Entropy Hub\" for all of web3. It would gather randomness from multiple sources (PoW miners, lava lamps, gyroscope), mix it, and allow any dApp or blockchain to pull from it for a small fee. Looking for feedback and collaborators!\n\n*Disclaimer: This post is less about academic research and more about the practical engineering and technology.*\n\n# Problem\n\nFor some context: if you're building a dApp (like a game) that needs a random number, the standard approach in web3 today is to use oracles with VRF capabilities, like Chainlink, Supra, or Gelato. You send a request in one transaction and get the random number back in a callback transaction.\n\nThe problem is, these services are often centralized and act as black boxes. Even when they use strong cryptography like VRF, they aren't fully transparent or decentralized.\n\n# Proposal\n\nSo, I thought, why not build a truly decentralized solution? An infrastructure layer that produces verifiable, unbiased entropy and serves as an \"Entropy Hub\" for all of web3.\n\n# How It Works\n\nThe core idea is to create a specialized L1 blockchain (an appchain), likely built with a framework like **Substrate**, dedicated to generating and distributing entropy. Here’s a high-level overview:\n\n1. **Proof-of-Work:** Miners use an ASIC-resistant PoW algorithm like RandomX. Instead of just securing the network, their primary job is to find and commit a high-quality **Entropy Seed** to each block they produce, earning rewards for their work.\n2. **Collection (External Sources):** We could integrate external, real-world entropy sources, similar to how Cloudflare uses lava lamps or how others use atmospheric noise. Lite-clients could help gather and validate the quality of this entropy.\n3. **Entropy Hub:** All these entropy inputs (from miners and external sources) are continuously mixed and stored in the \"Entropy Hub\" on the appchain.\n4. **Distribution:** Any blockchain, parachain, or dApp can request a chunk of entropy from the Hub by paying a small fee.\n5. **Incentives:** The fees are then distributed among the contributors (miners, external source providers) based on the quality and quantity of the entropy they provided.\n\nI want to make participation in this protocol as open and permissionless as possible.\n\nThanks for reading this far! I hope the idea is intriguing. I'm open to all feedback, critiques, and suggestions—please share your thoughts in the comments!\n\nLet's build the Entropy Layer for Web3 together.\n\n", "content_size_bytes": 2944}

Initial response was great, and few people pointed towards it's potential compatibility with smart contract. I just dropped the **no-std version** with a new feature: **compile-time enforced pure functions**. Here is how it works:\n\n## 🧠 **The #[pure] proc macro**\n\nThe `#[pure]` creates **compiler-enforced purity**:\n\n```rust\n#[pure]\nfn calculate_new_balances(ctx: TransactionContext) -> Result<TransactionContext, TokenError> {\n    // ✅ Can call other pure functions\n    let validated = validate_transfer_rules(ctx)?;  // Must also be #[pure]\n    let fees = calculate_protocol_fees(validated)?; // Must also be #[pure]\n    \n    // ❌ These won't compile - calling impure from pure context\n    // msg!(\"Logging from pure function\");  // Compile error!\n    // load_account_data(ctx.account_id)?;  // Compile error!\n    \n    Ok(apply_balance_changes(fees)?)\n}\n```\n\nOnce you mark a function `#[pure]`, it can ONLY call other `#[pure]` functions. The compiler enforces this recursively!\n\n## 🔥 **Solana Example**\n\n```rust\nfn process_transfer(accounts: &[AccountInfo], amount: u64) -> ProgramResult {\n    let context = load_initial_context(accounts, amount)?;\n    \n    let result = pipex!(\n        [context]\n        => |ctx| load_account_states(ctx)      // IMPURE: Blockchain I/O\n        => |ctx| validate_transfer(ctx)        // PURE: Business logic\n        => |ctx| calculate_new_balances(ctx)   // PURE: Math operations  \n        => |ctx| commit_to_accounts(ctx)       // IMPURE: State changes\n    );\n\n    handle_pipeline_result(result)\n}\n\n#[pure]  // 🎯 This function is guaranteed side-effect free\nfn validate_transfer(ctx: TransactionContext) -> Result<TransactionContext, TokenError> {\n    if ctx.instruction.amount == 0 {\n        return Err(TokenError::InvalidAmount);\n    }\n    \n    if ctx.from_balance < ctx.instruction.amount {\n        return Err(TokenError::InsufficientFunds);\n    }\n    \n    Ok(ctx)\n}\n```\n\n## 💡 **Why I think it matters**\n\n**1. Easy Testing** - Pure functions run instantly, no blockchain simulation needed\n**2. Audit-Friendly** - Clear separation between math logic and state changes\n**3. Composable DeFi** - Build complex logic from simple, guaranteed-pure primitives\n\n## 🛠 **For curious ones, you can include this rev to test it yourself**\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\npipex = { git = \"https://github.com/edransy/pipex\", rev=\"fb4e66d\" }\n```\n\n## 🔍 **Before vs After**\n\n**Traditional Solana** (everything mixed):\n```rust\npub fn process_swap(accounts: &[AccountInfo]) -> ProgramResult {\n    msg!(\"Starting swap\");  // Logging\n    let account = next_account_info(accounts)?;  // I/O\n    if balance < amount { return Err(...); }  // Validation mixed with I/O\n    account.balance -= amount;  // State mutation\n}\n```\n\n**With Pipex + #[pure]** (clean separation):\n```rust\npipex!(\n    context\n    => |ctx| load_accounts(ctx)        // IMPURE: Clear I/O boundary\n    => |ctx| validate_swap(ctx)        // PURE: Isolated business logic\n    => |ctx| calculate_amounts(ctx)    // PURE: Mathematical operations\n    => |ctx| commit_changes(ctx)       // IMPURE: Clear persistence boundary\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR**: Pipex no-std brings functional pipelines + compile-time pure function enforcement to Solana. This could lead to more secure, testable, and efficient smart contracts with clear separation of concerns.\n\nRepo: [ https://github.com/edransy/pipex/tree/no_std ]\n\nWhat do you think? 🎉", "content_size_bytes": 3501}

Most of the ideas I mention may have been existed before, but hey this is one man's ideas!  \n  \n**Before we start**  \n  \nIf you like working on any of these ideas and you think you can help as a co-founder, feel free to DM me. I check this website almost everyday and read new topics. So I may spend a few more minutes to read and answer DMs as well!  \n  \n**A little bit of my background**  \n  \nAlthough I have introduced myself before, I have to say this May I became 30 and I have experience of coding in different languages since the age of 12. At the age of 15, I made my very first app and sold it to a local real estate agency (it was just a sales management system written in Delphi and used Access as database!).  \n  \nAnyway, in March of 2023, I founded [Mann-E](https://mann-e.com/) which is an AI image generation platform. Since the day I launched Mann-E, there were suggestions for making it a web 3 based company but I never could find a good way to connect my business to web 3.  \n  \nIn this topic, I have ideas for a bunch of new *company* or *startup* ideas which can be easily integrated with web 3 (at least in my opinion) and I really need your thoughts on the topics as well.  \n  \nNow, let's go and review the ideas.  \n  \n**Idea 1: Generative Metaverse**  \n  \nIn my AI journey, I have came across some models for turning text prompt or image prompts into 3D files (mostly GLB files). So a place where people can get their hands on a piece of *virtual land* and design their monuments or houses with AI can be a cool idea.  \n  \n**Idea 2: Generate to Earn system**  \n  \nOkay, this is directly inspired by projects such as *tapswap* and *Hamster Kombat* but instead of making you busy with a Telegram mini app, you'll be busy by a website where you are generating images and by doing each generation you'll be rewarded. This idea came to my mind because in the whole path of my business of generative AI, I had struggles finding good data (mostly prompts to feed to different AI systems such as midjourney to generate a synthetic set of data). This way, you are providing the data for future AI systems and get a reward in form of a token.  \n  \nBut there is a problem here, who will invest on this idea? for example in previous idea, people may pay for 3D generation or may pay for the virtual land. How can we provide liquidity for the token proposed by this one? Community? Those \"Blockchain Grant\" systems? what? I really want to know this.  \n  \n**Idea 3: Bet on Sports Matches**  \n  \nI guess the whole game of bet/gamble in crypto space is much older than what I can think of. However, it was an idea in my mind.  \n  \n**Idea 4: Voting System**  \n  \nIt can be a fraud-proof voting system with little to no cost compared to traditional voting systems in organizations of syndications. For examples *Association of Digital Businesses* in my country had an election and they had to rent a whole hotel for 3 days in order to host all people to vote on candidates from different cities/provinces. If a voting system exists, they just pay a small fee for creating a new vote and the whole voting thing will be done on the chain with zero chance of vote fraud.  \n  \n**Idea 5: A crypto bank where people can turn their crypto assets into real world assets**  \n  \nI see websites similar to this before, but the idea is cool. Imagine you buy iTunes gift cards or any other similar goods with your crypto assets!  \n  \n**Idea 6: OF but on chain**  \n  \nIt seems controversial of course. But imagine a lot of people do not want a history of selling and buying that type of content in their credit card history. So why not making something on chain in order to help people have a safer place to buy and sell this type of content? Obviously it is more complex than it seems but this is the idea!  \n  \nWhat do you think about these 6 ideas? I tried to sort them from the safest to the craziest. I also am waiting for your input on this as well.", "content_size_bytes": 4178}

The idea is simple — but potentially powerful:\n\nWhat if it were possible to speculate on sentiment around public and private institutions — not just their stock price, but actual trust?\n\n⸻\n\nCore Concept:\n\nEach institution would have:\n\t•\tA Sentiment Contract (ERC-20 token) representing public trust.\n\t•\tA Public Trust Index (PTI) — a dynamic score from 0–850 based on user voting.\n\nUsers could:\n\t•\tLong, short, or hold sentiment contracts (via perpetuals or buying the token outright).\n\t•\tVote on the PTI — even without holding the token (holding gives your vote more weight).\n\t•\tTrack and speculate on public perception in real time — even for private companies like OpenAI, SpaceX, or TikTok.\n\n⸻\n\nWhy This Matters:\n\nMarkets already move on narrative. But there’s no transparent, on-chain way to speculate on trust itself — especially when public sentiment and market performance don’t align.\n\nToday, a company can have strong financials and still face widespread public distrust. Or vice versa. There’s a growing disconnect between Wall Street performance and real-world perception — between shareholders and actual consumers.\n\nThis protocol would aim to bridge that gap.\n\nThe goal isn’t to build a “truth oracle” — but rather a trust oracle: a way to capture sentiment, quantify it, and allow people to trade on it. Just like traders speculate on earnings or macro forecasts, this would let users speculate on public narratives — with 24/7 access, no KYC, and full transparency.\n\nIt would create an open speculation layer for credibility itself — something that could exist outside traditional finance.\n\n⸻\n\nOpen Questions I’m Still Thinking Through:\n\t•\tWould this feel useful, or too abstract?\n\t•\tWhat mechanisms could help limit whale manipulation of PTI scores?\n\t•\tShould token holders be rewarded for holding vs. trading?\n\t•\tAre there any protocols I should study for architectural inspiration?\n\n⸻\n\nI’m not a developer yet, but I’m learning.\nIf this concept resonates — or if you want to critique it, build on it, or collaborate — let’s talk.\n\nThanks for reading, I appreciate any and all feedback 🙏\n", "content_size_bytes": 2319}

The concept of equity multiples such as  the P/E ratio (price to earnings) is incredible useful in evaluating a company and their potential to produce returns based on their earnings.\n\nNow the P/E ratio is hard to apply to all tokens because not all tokens have the concept of earnings, but it's no secret that for a project/company to survive it has to have income to pay the bills, even if its in the form of donations or tokenomics.\n\nHere's what I've come up with so far - basically trying to find P/E equivalents for different types of crypto protocols:\n\n**1. Fee-Distributing Protocols (the \"dividend stocks\" of crypto)**\n\nFor protocols that actually share revenue with token holders, I'm using:\n\n* **P/DE ratio** = FDV ÷ Annual Distributed Earnings\n* Think of staking rewards, fee sharing, etc.\n* Based on some solid research from Sockin & Xiong's 2022 RFS paper on equity tokens and the recent NBER working paper by Cong on PoS valuations\n\n**2. Buyback & Burn Protocols (like corporate share buybacks)**\n\nWhen protocols burn tokens instead of distributing:\n\n* **P/BV ratio** = FDV ÷ Annual Burn Value\n* ETH post-EIP-1559 is the obvious example here\n* Grayscale did some good analysis on this, plus there's academic work from Cong & van Oordt at BIS\n\n**3.

I’m working on it solo, and it just went live on Arbitrum testnet.\n\nThe idea behind it is simple, but also kind of personal.\n\nWeb3 is supposed to be open and fair. But in practice, a lot of the people who actually help projects grow , the ones writing threads, making content, improving UX, fixing bugs, or spreading ideas, get nothing in return.\n\nNo allocation. No visibility. Not even a record that they were part of the story.\n\nAxynom is a protocol that tries to fix that. It runs on something I call *Proof of Growth*, a system where anyone can contribute to the project, and if that contribution adds value, it’s reviewed, approved, and rewarded.\n\nWhen that happens, the contributor earns something called *Growth Points* (GP). These are recorded on-chain and tied to your wallet. They act both as a kind of reputation and as a reward currency. Right now, GP can be redeemed for AXY tokens on testnet. After launch, those tokens will be redeemable one to one for mainnet AXY.\n\nThe system already works.  \nYou can submit work.  \nIt gets reviewed.  \nIf approved, GP is minted and added to your on-chain profile.  \nYou can claim tokens right now.  \nThere’s nothing to wait for.\n\nA few early contributors have already joined. The hub is up, the smart contracts are deployed, and the process from contribution to reward is live.\n\nThis is still early. It’s small. But it’s real.\n\nIf you’ve ever contributed to a Web3 project and felt like it went unnoticed, or if you’re interested in building systems where value flows more fairly, I’d love to hear what you think.\n\nDoes the model make sense?

The recipient only receives the crypto if they *open*the message. If they don’t, the crypto automatically returns to you after a set time (like 7 days). It’s all handled via smart contract — no middlemen.\n\nIf they like your message, they can choose to respond. If they don’t, no hard feelings — your funds are returned.\n\nIt’s a new way to cut through the noise, especially in a world where cold DMs and unsolicited emails rarely get noticed. With Priority Ping, attention becomes opt-in, incentivized, and respectful.\n\nWe’re designing it as a lightweight layer on top of Web3 identities — compatible with wallets, ENS, Lens, Farcaster handles, etc. Think of it like a trustless “stamp” for messaging.\n\n**Why it might work:**\n\n* **For senders:** You only spend if your message is actually opened. You’re no longer shouting into the void.\n* **For receivers:** You’re compensated for your time. No more endless spam or bots — only signals with some skin in the game.\n* **For both sides:** It’s fair, permissionless communication with built-in incentives.\n\nWe’ve had people compare it to Balaji’s Earn (but with refunds), and some say it feels like a Web3 postal service — especially with how expensive real-world postage has become. Businesses that send regular letters (like banks) could eventually use this to communicate on-chain more efficiently.\n\nOf course, this only works if the UX is simple enough. We’re building with wallet-native flows so that receiving and reading a message feels like opening an email — no technical steps, no clunky interfaces.\n\nNow we’re testing the concept with the community and would love your thoughts:\n\n* Would you use Priority Ping to reach someone important?\n* Would you be open to receiving messages like this?\n* What kinds of messages would you expect — or want — to see?\n* What concerns do you have around abuse, privacy, or UX?\n\nWe’re not trying to replace messaging apps — we’re building a tool for when something is *important*, and attention needs to be earned.\n\nAppreciate your honest thoughts, both good and bad.

Both are pursuing aggressive $TAO accumulation, supported by BitGo custody and staking infrastructure. But a new wave is forming: **private equity vaults**.\n\nOne of the most notable is **Tensor Suisse AG**, a Swiss-based vehicle structured as a regulated equity vault. Unlike the public players, it raises capital privately, offering exposure to **delegated TAO yield (\\~14–18% p.a.)**, with a long-term roadmap to operate its own **validator infrastructure** and participate in **subnet investments**. Think of it as a decentralized MicroStrategy with Swiss legal clarity.\n\nThese treasury vehicles solve three key problems:\n\n• Institutions don’t want to self-custody crypto  \n• Funds miss out on validator yield and APY compounding  \n• There’s no clean regulatory onramp into decentralized AI\n\nWith TAO capped at 21M tokens and institutional interest rising, early treasury vaults could become powerful NAV-compounding machines, providing scalable, compliant access to the decentralized AI frontier.\n\n**Curious to hear your thoughts:**\n\nDo you see TAO vaults as the next institutional gold rush in crypto?  \nAnd how does the private equity model (Tensor Suisse, etc.) compare to public tickers like OBLG and SNPX?", "content_size_bytes": 1595}

I started out as a developer maintaining a legacy .NET app with infrastructure in AWS. That’s where I first got interested in cloud architecture, which eventually led me down the AWS certification path and into more formal infrastructure and DevOps roles.\n\nI’m deeply interested in cryptocurrencies because of their potential to decentralize and democratize transactions. I am venezuelan, and in 2017/2018 I was able to send money to my family through [localbitcoins.net](https://localbitcoins.net/) in a very difficult time when all international transactions were blocked, Cryptocurrencies were (and still are) a lifeline for many people. Btw, I truly recommend [https://whycryptocurrencies.com/](https://whycryptocurrencies.com/), really good lecture, it really inspired me to start working on this project.\n\nUntil I started this project, I felt wary of cold wallets, mostly because I didn’t really understand how they worked internally. I never felt comfortable with anything other than MetaMask (though I’m not a huge fan of storing keys in browser storage either). Another app I used a lot is LemonCash, which functions more like an exchange, letting you use crypto and automatically convert it to pesos while supporting different tokens, so I decided to build a desktop cold wallet in Go, something that sits between both applications.  \n  \n Investigating about frameworks I ran into wails, and I decided to start building the HD wallet, not to create a product but to learn in the process and get familar with the industry.  I've been building it since January, in the beginning I thought of supporting a few tokens (like USDC, ETH, BTC, SOL).  At the moment I have only managed to build the ETH infrastructure, but this has turned into the side project I’ve stuck with the longest.   \n  \nUntil now, I’ve been building it quietly and sharing progress within my personal network. But with the amount of time and thought I’ve put into it, I felt it was time to open it up to the community, get feedback, and maybe even find people interested in contributing.  \n  \nHere’s the repo: [https://github.com/deaconPush/ubiDist/tree/main/wails/wallet](https://github.com/deaconPush/ubiDist/tree/main/wails/wallet), and here is a video with a basic [demo](https://files.catbox.moe/x8pzhr.mp4).   \n  \nIt’s still rough around the edges, and as it is my first Go project the structure is still pretty raw. I’ve been focusing on keeping the architecture flexible and avoiding overengineering. So far, I’ve implemented a basic UI to create and restore wallets, store data in a SQLite DB, and send ETH transactions to other accounts using the local Hardhat network. Next steps include improving security, adding integration tests, helpful logging, and starting to add support for new tokens.  \n  \nI’ve always been a big fan of open source but never had the self-confidence to contribute, maybe this is my way into that world.\n\nThanks for reading, happy to connect with like minded engineers/crypto enthusiasts!\n\n", "content_size_bytes": 3110}

Chainless Apps rethink dApp architecture from first principles. What Are Chainless Apps?  \nChainless Apps separate execution from trust and settlement. That’s the core idea.  \nInstead of being tightly coupled to a blockchain for every state change, Chainless Apps execute off-chain, prove correctness using verifiable computation (zkVMs, AVSs, or TEEs), and settle via the Agglayer into Ethereum.  \nThis enables:\n\n* Web2 responsiveness\n* Web3 verifiability\n* Seamless cross-chain UX\n\n Architectural Overview  \nChainless Apps are composed of four distinct, modular layers:\n\n1. **Execution Layer** – App-specific, off-chain logic that runs at native speed.\n2. **Trust Layer** – Flexible verification options (zkVMs like RiscZero/Succinct, AVSs via EigenLayer, or TEEs).\n3. **Bridge Layer** – Unified asset/message routing via the Agglayer.\n4. **Settlement Layer** – Anchor trust proofs to Ethereum (or the Agglayer itself in the future).\n\nEach application gets its own execution and trust environment, while inheriting Agglayer’s unified bridge and settlement layer. This allows for high throughput, lower cost, and superior UX — without sacrificing verifiability. Trust That Scales  \nWe don't dictate how apps establish trust — we give you a menu:\n\n* **zkVMs (e.g. RiscZero, Plonky3)**: Cryptographic proofs of correctness\n* **AVSs (e.g. EigenLayer)**: Committee-based attestation\n* **TEEs (e.g. Intel SGX)**: Hardware-secured execution\n\nDevelopers choose the model that best fits their application’s needs. The system is modular from day one. The Role of Agglayer  \nAgglayer connects Chainless Apps to the rest of Web3:\n\n* **Unified Bridge**: Native routing for assets and messages across chains\n* **Pessimistic Proofs**: Prevent over-withdrawals and race conditions\n* **Fast Interop (coming soon)**: Sub-second messaging between chains\n* **Proof Aggregation (coming soon)**: Bundle ZK proofs across apps to minimize L1 cost\n\nThe result is a shared liquidity layer across applications and chains — composable, verifiable, and synchronized. \n\nProof-of-Concept: zkSpot\n\nWe built zkSpot to demonstrate what Chainless Apps unlock.  \nIt's a high-performance spot exchange that runs app logic inside a TEE, then proves correctness via zkVM. With fast settlement, native asset support, and Agglayer routing, zkSpot behaves like a CEX — but is verifiable like a DEX.  \nThis model generalizes to any interactive or high-throughput app:\n\n* Real-time games\n* Social protocols\n* Prediction markets\n* Enterprise dashboards\n\n**Learn More**  \nThis work builds on prior concepts like A-Z apps and modular rollup architecture.

This applies not just to memecoins or purposeless tokens, but even to legitimate projects with real innovation and flawed tokenomics.\n\n**My proposed solution:** A design that converts chaotic momentum into stable, gradual growth using math and a touch of community coordination.\n\n**Feasibility rationale:** Tokens like DAI prove that the power of math and community can stabilize the price of a coin and peg it to a value. We can apply the same principle power with a different design but **instead of a stabilized peg, a stabilized growth.**\n\nI have in mind a complete technical design and the ability to implement it, primarily in solidity (for eth or an eth based chain). It is completely trustless with no centralized control and includes a semi-DAO mechanism where users can collaborate and direct the assets backing their tokens into permissioned smart contracts so they can capitalize on the assets they control but can't force use the assets of others.\n\n**Key Features/Properties:**\n\n* Tokens acquired directly from the protocol can have a \"forever break-even liquidity\" while the price is algorithmically designed to grow at a stable pace.\n   * (For a CEX to utilize this feature they would have to integrate the smart contract interaction. People who spot trade it are exposed to financial loses).\n* Token-backing assets are not trapped and can be funneled for utilization .\n* Protocol users can vote/vouch.\n   * Protocol fees for yield.\n   * Growth parameters (within pre-limits).\n   * Prevent the release of team tokens.\n      * Don't like the team? Vote that they'd get nothing.\n   * Funnel funds to an external contract using a minimum threshold at deadline logic.\n* Verify onchain a statement they made. An immutable proof that they said what they said.\n* A complete fair launch with a given grace period to join at the base price before growth logic initiates.\n   * A genuinely benevolent trustless design. \"A token Coffeezilla would be proud of\".\n\n**Reasons for me not to do it:**\n\n* I lack marketing skills.\n* I lack visual design skills (I can do a practical UI but not a conventionally beautiful/attractive design).\n* UX may be complex.\n* Team disincentivized. My intent for a fair financial design may discourage potential collaborators.\n* Regulatory gray zone due big brother progress proroguing governments.\n* Hard work and effort that requires motivation I don't currently have.\n* \"Too Ethical for Degens\" In this market, many people want to gamble and see 100x returns within a few days, they don't appreciate steady appreciation and those who do lean toward Bitcoin and large blue chip coin.\n\n**Reason why it should be done:**\n\n* Addresses a Real Problem. Offers an innovative low risk financial opportunity that is brave enough to see beyond short term greed.\n* Innovative Tokenomics\n* Built-in Integrity. Potential collaboration with Tegridy Farms.\n* Realistic semi-DAO features.

I would appreciate any thoughts/ideas here, as I'm still not sure if it would actually work in practice. Thanks!\n\n**Delayed Proof-of-Work (DPoW)**\n\nA theoretical consensus mechanism for energy-efficient, time-regulated mining.\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1. A new block is added to the chain.\n2. All miners start computing a VDF (Verifiable Delay Function) with the latest block's hash as the input.\n3. The VDF is designed to take 4 minutes to complete, enforcing a mandatory idle period.\n4. The \\~1 minute mining period begins when miners complete the VDF.\n5. Miners compete to find a valid PoW for a new block, which includes the VDF output in the header.\n6. The first miner to find a valid hash broadcasts the new block to the network.\n7. The block is verified by nodes by checking the VDF's output is correct for the previous block hash, and that the PoW is valid.\n\nThis cycle of a 4 minute idle period and a brief mining period continues.\n\n**Key Advantages**:\n\n* The idle-mine cycle allows the network to operate with \\~1/5 of the hash power of a standard PoW blockchain while still taking advantage of the security properties of PoW.\n* During the 4 minute idle period, the blockchain is guaranteed to be static. The predictable delay means blocks are propagated and confirmed in a more synchronized fashion, which could reduce synchronization issues and orphaned blocks.\n\n**Potential Issues:**\n\n* VDFs can be computed slightly faster on hardware with higher clock speeds or specialized circuits, resulting in some miners having a longer mining period.\n* The short mining-window means that miners on faster connections will have a significant advantage over slower connections, as they will be able to propagate a mined block faster.\n* The VDF also uses energy, although negligible compared to the amount that algorithms use.\n* Miners might redirect their hash power to other cryptocurrencies during the delay period, which would undermine the goal of reducing energy consumption.\n* A malicious miner who obtains or predicts the next block could start precomputing the VDF early, gaining an unfair advantage.", "content_size_bytes": 2201}

The simplest way to think of it is as a standardized language that defines communication between the hardware and software.\n\nThough RISC-V was not originally built for blockchain purposes, its open design allowed crypto developers to leverage it for building virtual machines that could generate zero-knowledge proofs at far lower resource costs than the EVM.\n\nThe outcome is what’s known as a zero knowledge virtual machine (zkVM), which enables developers to write applications in high level languages like Rust without needing to be trained in cryptography.\n\nIn the absence of zkVMs, companies that want to leverage zk tech to build a privacy-secure application to process payroll/healthcare data would need to spend much more time writing custom zk circuits that cannot be easily changed after deployment (unlike a zkVM where devs could simply recompile RISC-V code).\n\nThoughts?", "content_size_bytes": 1568}

Please chime in to refine this. So, my project is using zero-knowledge proofs and I am finding out that people who are not familiar with the concept (and even those who think they are) are struggling to understand it. I came up with a story below to help non-technical and technical people understand how this would work on a blockchain.\n\nSo, here goes:\n\nJohn has $1,000 and needs to send $100 to Bill. Nobody can know the amounts that are being sent or how much money John or Bill has. \n\nLet's break this down.\n\n1. John owns $1,000.\n\nInstead of waving cash around, he seals the money inside a thick, light-proof envelope. Before he seals it, he presses a special wax stamp that embeds a cryptographic code tied to \"$1,000 + some random noise.\" That stamp is tamper-evident: anyone can scan it later and be certain nothing inside has been swapped, yet the scan reveals zero about the real amount.\n\nThe stamp fixes the value without exposing it.\n\n2. Splitting the funds - still in the dark.\n\nJohn now prepares two new opaque envelopes:\n\n\\- Envelope A (for Bill)  \n\\- Envelope B (change back to John)\n\nHe secretly puts $100 in A and $900 in B, adds fresh random noise to each, and presses a new wax stamp on both. Again, the stamps hide the figures but lock them in place.\n\n3. The referee's balance test.\n\nA neutral blockchain referee (software, not a person) receives only the three stamp codes, never the cash. With some clever math the referee checks two rules:\n\n\\- Conservation: \"Stamp(original) = Stamp(A) + Stamp(B)\"  \n\\- Range proof: each new envelope holds a non-negative amount (no hidden debt).\n\nBecause the math is homomorphic (computations can be performed without decryption), the referee can confirm both rules without peeling open any envelope.\n\nIf the equations hold, the referee signs a one-line certificate: \"John's transfer verified - no amounts disclosed.\"\n\nThat certificate (the zero-knowledge proof) is what gets written to the next block.\n\n4. What the world sees.\n\n\\- Everyone can audit the certificate and know the transaction is sound.  \n\\- Nobody learns that Envelope A contains $100, or even that Bill is receiving $100 instead of $5,000 or $42.  \n\\- The original and change amounts stay private, yet the ledger's arithmetic stays perfect.\n\nSummary:\n\nZero-knowledge proofs are like tamper-proof stamps on opaque envelopes: they let the blockchain confirm that John's $1,000 was correctly split into a payment and change without ever revealing how much cash sits inside each envelope.", "content_size_bytes": 2557}

Traditionally, music royalties have been concentrated in the hands of major investors and industry gatekeepers, leaving little room for independent participation.\n\nA recently developed model utilizes NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) on the Polygon network to represent fractional ownership of a song’s royalty rights. Each NFT grants its holder a proportional share of the royalties generated by the song. This is enabled through smart contracts that automate revenue distribution transparently and efficiently.\n\nThis approach brings forward several technical insights worth discussing:\n\n* **Scalability via Polygon:** The Polygon network was chosen for its low fees and fast transaction throughput, which are crucial for managing the microtransactions that come with music royalties.\n* **Smart contract automation:** Revenue distribution is fully automated through smart contracts, ensuring each NFT holder receives their share without needing intermediaries.\n* **Transparency and traceability:** All royalty-related transactions are logged on a public blockchain, increasing visibility and trust among participants.\n\nThis model not only democratizes access to music investment but also provides a clear example of how blockchain can solve centralization issues across various sectors.\n\nThe project is currently under development.

Additionally, I am not citing the name of my project, or trying to promote it in any way, just looking for advice from fellow developers.\n\n\n\nThat said, a little context. The distributed capability of blockchain tech is what originally drew me to the crypto space 10 or so years ago. I have always loved the concept of essentially using greed as a key motivator to create a secure and trustless asset. I find it inspiring, as fundamentally, no ecosystem can exist free of avarice, and historically, the accumulation of malefactors is what inevitably degrades the integrity of the system. Although far from perfect, the opportunities created by this technology seems to offer the closest function for turning the greed of potential bad actors into a positive force, by rewarding meritorious action such as mining, staking, and auditing, to such a degree that it disincentivizes defectors.\n\n\n\nLooking at what other issues that blockchain could potentially create merit based cooperation for universal good in, one of the biggest economic complaints that seems to constantly plague the world, regardless of nation, political affiliation, ect... is the poor management of inflation, leading to ever increasing escalation and instability of financial assets. Cryptocurrencies have already made inroads into this issue, such as with Bitcoin having a finite supply, and thus a deflationary trajectory, or in the case of dozens of cryptos that have regulated, transparent inflation rates.\n\n  \nIt occurred to me though that although many cryptocurrencies have decentralized consensus that controls one or more aspects of the tokens inflation / deflation, I cannot think of one that has put full control of both mechanisms into the hands of the token holders. There are clear reasons for this, and in many cases I can fully understand why the developers would not want to risk bad actors having any part of their tokens minting and burning rates, nor is it appropriate most of the time. \n\n\n\nStill, the idea is intriguing, for, if given the opportunity, would a community of token holders be capable of self regulating the use of inflationary and deflationary mechanisms, ultimately working together to build the ecosystems financial value and stability, or, would short term greed and \"pump and dump\" malefactors overwhelm the system and cause a total loss of stability?\n\n  \nPersonally I find the concept to be fascinating, so out of curiosity, a little over a year ago, I started building a token model to test this socioeconomic theory, as well as my own programming ability. Since then I have gone through several revisions, with my first few concept designs falling apart almost immediately do to architecture flaws, exorbitant on-chain fees, extreme transaction latency, and issues incorporating off-chain entities. However, about a year later and I have created what I am confident is a functional and working prototype to test my thesis, building my model using the EIP-2535 standard, with independent facets for the inflationary and deflationary modules that can be activated and deactivated via a staked voting mechanism by token holders, and with certain mechanisms, once activated, relying on off-chain entities via a ZK Rollup to handle computations to cut gas fees, with off-chain \"nodes\" handling the off-chain computations, and incentivized through the ability to host and profit from staked tokens to their nodes. Bad actors can be penalized for trying to use a node to send corrupted information by quarantining of the effected node, and both node operators and token holders are incentivized to partake in voting by the direct impact on the total supply of the token. In order to ensure that the token is not pushed to a unsustainable supply in either direction, the supply is \"rubber-banded\", ensuring that the further the supply gets from the initial supply, the more difficult activating and maintaining the supporting mechanisms will become.\n\n\n\n It was particularly challenging, as prior to this project I have never worked with either the EIP-2535 standard or ZK Rollups, and I stumbled more then I would like to admit.\n\n  \nAll of this is to say, I am looking for input, criticism, and questions that can help me hunt down any remaining flaws that I may have been to close to the project to see, prior to its launch. Shortly after I first started this project, I posted an inquiry here about potential mechanisms to integrate into the token, and some of the responses I got were quite inspired. I am hoping that this post may evoke some similar insights.\n\nThank you for your time reading this, and for your responses if you are so inclined.", "content_size_bytes": 4870}

But a closer look at how eth_decrypt functioned reveals cracks in this reasoning, suggesting the decision might mask a deeper motive.\n\nHere’s how it worked: eth_decrypt and eth_getEncryptionPublicKey relied on asymmetric encryption. A third party could use eth_getEncryptionPublicKey to fetch a user’s public encryption key, derived from their Ethereum private key (ECDSA on secp256k1). They could then encrypt data—potentially vast amounts—using this key, e.g. via ECIES (Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme). The wallet owner would decrypt it with eth_decrypt, using the same private key that signs transactions (e.g., via eth_signTypedData_v4). MetaMask argued that this dual use could expose the private key, risking account security\n\nBut this doesn’t hold up under scrutiny. In asymmetric encryption, the public key is meant to be shared—encrypting millions of messages with it doesn’t inherently compromise the private key, provided the scheme (like ECIES) is secure with proper nonce usage and authentication. Decryption with the private key is distinct from signing; it doesn’t generate a public output like a signature does, so the \"same key\" risk feels overstated. True vulnerabilities—like padding oracle attacks or side-channel leaks—would stem from implementation flaws, not the concept itself. Yet MetaMask’s 2023 blog post admitted no known exploits existed. If the risk was theoretical, why axe a feature that enabled private on-chain communication\n\nThe \"same key\" argument fits symmetric encryption better, where one key handles both encryption and decryption, amplifying misuse risks. But eth_decrypt was asymmetric, making the justification seem misapplied. MetaMask pledged support for a new encryption standard, like EIP-5630 (proposed in 2022 for safer key derivation via eth_performECDH), but as of April 2025, it’s still unfinished, leaving developers in the lurch.

They will stop only once the total cost of production equals the total block reward (i.e. when marginal profit == 0)\n\nHowever, not all PoW protocols are as maximally energy-inefficient as Nakamoto Consensus. Some PoW protocols reduce waste and redundancy from uncle and orphaned blocks by reusing normally-discarded blocks.\n\n**TL;DR**:\n\n* **PoW Longest-chain**: Makes blocks expensive to produce with constant difficulty adjustments. All effort is discarded/wasted except for blocks produced in the longest-chain. Has weak economic security incentives. Weak to 51% attacks.\n* **PoW DAG**: Makes blocks cheap to produce. Accepts all valid blocks without discarding. Has moderate economic security incentives, but weak spam-protection. Strong against safety-type 51% attacks, but weak against liveness attacks.\n* **PoW GHOSTDAG**: Makes blocks cheap to produce. Accepts nearly all valid transactions. Has moderately-strong economic security incentives. Strong against safety-type 51% attacks, and moderately-strong against liveness attacks.\n* **PoS DAG**: Makes blocks cheap to produce. Accepts all valid blocks without discarding. Has strong economic security for both safety and liveness.\n\n-------------------------------\n\n**Longest-chain is an Energy-spending maximizer**\n\nBitcoin's longest-chain/heaviest-weight is a family of consensus protocols that maximizes energy-spending (and e-waste production) until the marginal profit reaches zero. It will stop only when the cost of production exceeds the security budget from its block rewards.\n\nEven as mining rigs become more efficient at producing SHA256 hashes (CPU -> GPU -> ASIC -> faster ASIC), the never-ending difficulty adjustments completely nullify that efficiency increase.\n\nThere is major miner misalignment of economic incentive under longest-chain because those providing security (miners) do not have the same goals as those receiving the security (holders).\n\n**Is it possible to design a PoW protocol that is less wasteful?**\n\nThe main problem with longest-chain is that it wastes computations. Everyone is trying to build a block, but everyone's efforts get thrown out while only the winner's block is accepted. One way to decrease wastefulness is to not discard effort. There is a way to use discarded blocks under which is to use other consensus protocols like DAGs and GHOSTDAG.\n\n**What is a DAG, and why is it more efficient and more secure?**\n\nA DAG is another category of Distributed Ledger Technologies (blockchains are also DLTs), that has a mesh-like structure instead of a linear chain of blocks (e.g. blockchain). All valid blocks are accepted, and none are thrown away unless they're invalid or have bad signatures. Thus nothing gets wasted. Blocks are connected to each other like a mesh and ordered based on time-equivalents. Nano and the original IOTA (it later upgraded to PoS) are both PoW DAGs, and they're both extremely efficient.\n\nComputations are not wasted, and there doesn't need to be a constant difficulty adjustment. Blocks are constantly being produced at low cost (sub-pennies) and high throughput (thousands of TPS).\n\nIn addition, longest-chain protocol is weak to 51% attacks, especially when block production is slow and there is a pool of transactions waiting to be added (a mempool). When block production is fast and the pool is usually empty, reorg and censorship attacks from 51% attacks become largely irrelevant. Sure, blocks can be reorged or censored, but the throughput is so high that transactions get added anyways by other miners seconds after the attack. So the attack only affects other miner's block rewards, which are mostly insignificant anyways. This nearly nullifies the effectiveness of 51% attacks.\n\nTechnically, there is no mining for adding transactions. The mining is mainly for spam-prevention, which is an issue I will cover later.\n\n**What is the GHOSTDAG consensus protocol?**\n\nGHOSTDAG is a portmanteau of GHOST (Greedy Heaviest Observed SubTree, Ethereum's original PoW protocol) and DAG.\n\nLongest-chain protocol throws away blocks that are not in the longest-chain. Those discarded blocks are called uncle or orphaned blocks. GHOST uses uncle and orphaned blocks as part of the weight calculations for determining the heaviest-chain, which makes it more secure and efficient than vanilla longest-chain.\n\nGHOSTDAG goes a step further than GHOST. There are 2 versions of this. One version includes orphaned blocks into the chain in a pseudo-DAG-like manner. The other option discards the blocks, but includes the transactions from those discarded blocks as long as they're valid. Either way, computations are not being wasted. They have the same benefits as a DAG.\n\nUnlike with Nano's version of a DAG, GHOSTDAG (Kaspa's previous consensus protocol) has actual mining, which is mainly used for both spam-prevention and for security.\n\n**What's the downside with DAGs?**\n\nThere's always a tradeoff. For DAGs with high throughput, it's spam.\n\nLongest-chain's ultimate goal is to maximize energy-spending (and e-waste production) until the block reward is expended. DAG's goal is to maximize block production until transaction demand is fully-met.\n\nDAGs are so fast and efficient at producing blocks that they can become extremely spammy and sometimes have issues with liveness.\n\nNano had this problem because it went to the extreme of having no fees. Everyone was a miner, and everyone was constantly producing blocks. This leads to storage bloat and increased node/RPC hardware requirements. Mining was practically costless, but full nodes were not being compensated for storing the full ledger, and ledgers can grow very quickly when throughput is high.\n\nThus DAGs need some kind of process to reduce spam. Nano adds a small Proof of Work mechanism to combat spam, but they probably didn't go far enough. Nodes/RPCs are still not being compensated, and they're partially responsible for security. GHOSTDAG improves on this by requiring miners and a transaction fee paid to miners. This lessens the burden for security on uncompensated nodes and shifts it to the miners.\n\nSo it's possible to produce a partially secure, safe, and efficient PoW by using DAGs or GHOSTDAGs. There is still some minor/miner misalignment of economic incentive because under PoW, those providing security do not have the same economic incentives as those receiving security.\n\n**PoS DAGs**\n\nGoing one step further ...\n\nA PoS DAG protocol is even more secure. On top of all the benefits of DAGs, now validators are economically-compensated for providing security, and they have economic incentive to provide security, so the interest of those providing security and those receiving security are aligned.", "content_size_bytes": 6956}

There have been plenty of PoW blockchains with smaller security budgets that have been ruined by 51% attacks, which led to large reorgs or double-spends. Historically, Bitcoin's security budget has increased between each cycle, but this increase has been decreasing from the start, and has now reached an inflection point. Transaction fees on average still only cover 1% of the block reward and are completely insufficient to cover for Bitcoin's security.\n\nAs of March 2025, Bitcoin security budget, when CPI-adjusted, has **declined over 45%** in real value compared to 4 years ago (sources: \"Miners Revenue\" from Blockchain.com, CPI data from St. Louis FRED).\n\nThere is a well-studied, recent research paper covering this long-term systemic risk to Bitcoin:\n\n**\"The Imminent (and Avoidable) Security Risk of Bitcoin Halving\"** - https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4801113\n\t\nThis research paper from Apr 2024 analyzes the long-term effects of Bitcoin halvings on Bitcoin's security budget and Bitcoin's security.\n\nDue to the halvings, Bitcoin's security relative to the amount being protected (aka the \"security budget ratio\") roughly halves every 4 years. Transactions fees have not been rising enough to make up for the loss in block subsidy. In fact, transaction fees on average still only cover 1% of the total block subsidy. The Cost of Attack (CoA) on Bitcoin is expected to continue declining in the long run.\n\n####**The researchers identify many major long-term issues for Bitcoin's security model**:\n\n* **Misaligned security incentives**: Bitcoin miners are profit-driven. Unlike with PoS, Bitcoin miners do not have strong economic incentive to protect Bitcoin when mining is no longer profitable. There is economic loss in protecting Bitcoin against a strong 51% attacker.\n* **Declining security budget ratio**: The \"widening divergence between the decreasing security budget and the rising total value of Bitcoin has been identified as a substantial long-term security problem\".\n* **Price instabilities**: \"can push mining activity far below its equilibrium value\" where \"the hash rate required by a 51% attacker is substantially reduced\"\n* **Secondary markets from unprofitable mining**: \"In our default scenario, the 28% of miners that become unprofitable in post-halving equilibrium may be willing to sell their hardware. Then an attacker who aims to acquire 50% of the total hash rate could buy this cheap hardware.\"\n* **Cost of Attack**: Was previously expected to be $5-20B in mining equipment, but possibly much cheaper due to secondary markets. Ongoing cost is $100M/day cost for maintaining a 51% attack.\n* **Timing attacks**: Due to difficulty adjustments around halvings, the total hash rates can be up to three times lower than before the halving, making Bitcoin 3x easier to 51% attack.\n* **Insufficient Transaction Fees**: Transaction fees on average have not risen at all, and are too low to cover for the loss in block subsidy from halvings\n* **Goldfinger attacks**: \"Stakeholders with intentions to undermine Bitcoin or profit from short positions may actively engage in Goldfinger attacks\"\n\nNote that the researchers based their figures on S9 ASIC miners since those are readily available on secondary markets. The CoA using newer S19 and S21 miners should be even cheaper by up to 3x because they are much more efficient.\n\n####**Possible solutions**\n\nThe authors recommend several solutions, all of which require controversial hard forks.\n\n* Removing supply cap and having permanent block subsidy issuance\n* Imposing minimum mandatory transaction fees\n* Switching to other more secure consensus protocols (like PoS)\n* Using a gradual inflation-reduction curve to eliminate sudden shocks in mining drops from halvings\n* Implementing a smaller max difficulty-adjustment\n\nTheir primary recommendation is to remove the supply cap and allow for permanent sustainable block subsidy issuance.

Coin Issuance & Initial Distribution\n\n* **Decentralized Launch Mechanism:** A **ZK-proof-secured launchpad** allows early participants to mint coins by proving computational work or stake via privacy-preserving methods (e.g., ZK-SNARKs).\n* **Vesting Contracts:** Coins allocated to core developers/validators are locked in time-released contracts (e.g., 3-5 years) to prevent premine abuse.\n* **Dynamic Supply:** A minimal inflation rate (1-2% annually) funds staking rewards, incentivizing long-term validator participation.\n\n# 3. DAG Referencing for Spent-Commitment Accumulation\n\n* **Transaction Nodes & Multiple Parents:** Transactions form nodes in a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**, referencing multiple parent commitments to establish lineage.\n* **Conflict Resolution:** Each commitment can only be spent once; referencing the same parent in multiple transactions triggers a conflict resolved via heaviest-subtree rules.\n* **Append-Only Structure:** The DAG enforces a partial ordering of spends, enabling efficient pruning after finalization.\n\n# 4. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) for Privacy & Integrity\n\n* **Proof at Spend Time:** Every transaction includes a ZKP verifying:\n   1. Ownership of the spent commitment.\n   2. Valid transition to new commitments.\n   3. Conservation of value (inputs = outputs).\n* **Batch Proofs:** Use **recursive SNARKs** to aggregate proofs for entire DAG branches, reducing verification overhead.\n* **Hybrid Privacy:** Users can opt for transparent UTXO-style transactions (no ZKP) for non-sensitive transfers.\n* **Hardware Acceleration:** Optimized ZKP backends (e.g., Groth16 on GPUs, Halo2 on FPGAs) accelerate proof generation/verification.\n\n# 5. Avalanche-Style Probabilistic Finality + Minimal PoS\n\n* **Probabilistic Sampling:**\n   * Transactions are repeatedly sampled by random validator subsets.\n   * Acceptance requires **supermajority approval** (e.g., 95% stake-weighted consensus).\n* **Validator Economics & Security:**\n   * **Fee Market Integration:** Transactions bid fees in the native token, distributed to validators. Fees escalate during congestion.\n   * **Slashing Conditions:**\n      * **Double-Voting:** Validators endorsing conflicting transactions lose staked tokens.\n      * **Liveness Faults:** Persistent offline validators face partial slashing.\n   * **Delegated Staking:** Small token holders delegate stake to professional validators, improving decentralization.\n* **Consensus Enhancements:**\n   * **BFT Finality Gadget:** A Tendermint-like BFT layer finalizes checkpoints after dispute periods, resolving network partitions.\n   * **Data Availability Sampling (DAS):** Erasure coding ensures checkpoint data remains available even if 25% of validators disappear.\n\n# 6. MMR-Based Accumulators for Global Pruning\n\n* **Spent-Commitment Updates:** Spent commitments are appended to a **Merkle Mountain Range (MMR)**, an append-only accumulator.\n* **Global MMR Checkpoints:** Validators finalize MMR snapshots via BFT consensus every epoch (e.g., 24 hours). Pruning deletes pre-checkpoint DAG data.\n* **Light Client Efficiency:**\n   * **P2P Attestations:** Light clients query multiple peers for MMR roots, cross-validating via majority consensus.\n   * **Fraud Proofs:** Compact proofs allow nodes to challenge invalid checkpoints, enabling light clients to reject bad states.\n\n# Optional Enhancements\n\n# A) PoH-Like Timestamps (Specialized Time-Stamping)\n\n* **Objective:** Use a **Proof of History** mechanism to timestamp DAG transactions, simplifying conflict resolution.\n* **Benefit:** Provides canonical ordering for forks and reduces reliance on network timestamps.\n\n# B) Chain-Key Threshold Signatures\n\n* **Mechanism:** Validators collaboratively sign MMR checkpoints using **BLS threshold signatures**, producing a single compact signature.\n* **Benefit:** Light clients verify checkpoints with one signature, reducing bandwidth overhead.\n\n# C) VDF (Verifiable Delay Function) for Spam Prevention\n\n* **Design:** Each transaction requires a **VDF proof** (e.g., 2-second delay) to deter spam.\n* **Adaptive Difficulty:** Difficulty adjusts based on network load (low during normal use, high during attacks).", "content_size_bytes": 5136}

This wasn’t a novel idea on my part, of course, but from what I’ve gathered based on a quick Google search, it seems like most of the discussion around this topic has been around the use of blockchain technologies to create a complete, end-to-end voting system that would completely replace our current voting system.  From what I can tell, though, it seems like there may be some significant vulnerabilities associated with blockchain voting systems (fraud, manipulation/exploitation, etc.) that would need to be addressed before the blockchain could be taken seriously as a viable option to completely replace our existing voting systems, ya?  \n\nWhat I’m wondering, though, without getting into any of the details of how a potential blockchain system that’s similar to what I’m envisioning would actually operate, I’m curious if there are any potential practical applications to use blockchain technologies to create some sort of separate but parallel system (as opposed to a system that would completely replace the existing voting system) that could help support/substantiate the results of a free and fair election… Or that - in the event that there had been widespread election fraud/interference - could at least provide some sort of initial indication that there had been so that there would at least be some justification for there to be some type of additional audit process and/or investigation to ensure that the election had indeed been fair and free.  \n\nTruthfully, though, I don’t really know too much about how our current voting system in the US functions, and even less about crypto and blockchain technologies, unfortunately.  So… with that disclosure out of the way, I guess I’d like to know if there would be any value in creating a blockchain system that could provide a real time “shadow count” of the votes that are being cast during an election, whereby individual users would be able to submit their “digital ballot” to the blockchain, which would allow the system to keep real time vote counts based on each individual user’s voting district.  The rationale being that if the official vote tally were to deviate significantly from the blockchain’s vote count (or vote ratio, at least), then that might be a red flag for society at least to look into the matter a bit more closely, perhaps?  And also, another potential function/feature of this system might be for there to be a means by which, once the official ballots had finally been counted, users could check and verify that their official ballot had been processed correctly and that the votes on their official ballot aligned with the votes that they’d included on their digital/blockchain ballot, and if there were some sort of discrepancy, users could report or flag it somehow through the blockchain so that it would be possible to identify any instances in which there appeared to be an inordinate amount of flags/reports in a particular area/district that may have been associated with some sort of election interference, perhaps?  \n\nAnyways, I’m sure that there’s a million potential issues that I’m not even considering here and it’s also very possible that this is a dumb idea that’s not even worth responding to, but in the off chance that there’s some kind and knowledgeable Redditor out there who’s willing to indulge my curiosity, I figured I might as well ask.  So, yeah, what do you think?  What sorts of things would I need to consider if I were to create such a system?  Major obstacles in developing and/or maintaining it?  Major limitations?  I appreciate any information you might have to offer on this topic since I (obviously) know very little!  Excited to read your responses!  Thanks, y’all! \n", "content_size_bytes": 3885}

Obviously, at the end of it, even though the source code is available on GitHub  and open source, that doesn't matter one bit, as someone is still taking this code and running the build scripts and then publishing the new version to the app store.\n\nThere is nothing stopping said individual from making some uncommitted changes locally before building and releasing a new version of the app (so not visible publicly on GitHub, etc.). These changes could purposefully introduce any number of malicious behaviours into the app, such as 1) deterministic private key generation for new wallets or 2) an inconspicuous private key logging mechanism or 3) have all transaction signing simply send to addresses that this individual owns. Effectively draining users' funds until people realize and the app gets rolled back or taken down. Even an hour of time with a malicious version out there is enough to cause significant financial loss.\n\nThis is my biggest fear with hot wallets. The more popular they get, and the more people are using them to store a large amount of bitcoin, cumulatively, the more tempting this becomes to the individual with the ability to roll out app updates. It just needs to get into the wrong hands.\n\nSome ways in which this could be mitigated:\n\n1. If Apple would allow users to disable automatic updates only for certain individual apps (such as hot wallets for example), and if they would allow checksum verifications with source code in some way, then the user could update to a new version on their own once they verify and audit the code themselves, or allow time to pass for others in the community to do so, etc.\n2. If I somehow knew that Apple placed an extreme level of scrutiny for certain app updates, such as hot wallets, then this would at least be something.. But I truly have no idea if they apply any more rigor when reviewing actual code changes of hot wallets vs some random game.\n\nOr perhaps I am missing something and this is well protected against?

I am currently taking a course regarding blockchain technology and my professor has us following along the Princeton Book on \"Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies\".\n\n[https://d28rh4a8wq0iu5.cloudfront.net/bitcointech/readings/princeton\\_bitcoin\\_book.pdf](https://d28rh4a8wq0iu5.cloudfront.net/bitcointech/readings/princeton_bitcoin_book.pdf)   (page 34-36)\n\nHere is a youtube video covering the very same material:\n\n[https://youtu.be/fOMVZXLjKYo?si=oTFDviBG\\_Pj51EJb&t=1487](https://youtu.be/fOMVZXLjKYo?si=oTFDviBG_Pj51EJb&t=1487)\n\nNow I am taking issue with the Merkle Tree explanation provided in this book. However to question material provided by Princeton would seem inconceivable. So I would like to ask this subreddit for clarification before I make a fool of myself in front of my professor. But I genuinely understand this book to be misrepresenting the merkle tree structure. I would APPRECIATE your feedback to my post and let me know what you think. Have I misunderstood something? Is the book making an error?\n\nOk, on to the material. Here is a direct quote from the book.\n\n>Suppose we have a number of blocks containing data. These blocks comprise the leaves of our tree. We group these data blocks into pairs of two, and then for each pair, we build a data structure that has two hash pointers, one to each of these blocks. These data structures make the next level up of the tree. We in turn group these into groups of two, and for each pair, create a new data structure that contains the hash of each. We continue doing this until we reach a single block, the root of the tree.\n\nHere is a corresponding figure presenting a merkle tree structure from the book:\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/UnpEjqJ.png](https://i.imgur.com/UnpEjqJ.png)\n\nREBUTTAL:\n\nThe specific grievance is:\n\n>we build a data structure that has two hash pointers, one to each of these blocks.\n\nI claim this is not the case(with sources provided later). I claim the data structure(parent node) that is made for each pair contains the hash of the concatenation of the children. So if there is a pair of leaves A and B, the parent node does NOT contain two hash pointers for each leaf which is written as H(A) H(B) in the book's diagram. Instead, it contains a single hash of both A and B concatenated, that is  denoted as H(A||B).\n\nFurther, there are no pointers which let you instantly hop from the parent to its children. The only way to find the child given a parent in practice is by using index arithmetic because all of the nodes in a binary tree can be denoted using indexing. And indexing follows a structure that lets you navigate the tree.\n\nI claim the above misunderstanding leads to a further misunderstanding regarding a proof of membership. As I understand, a proof of membership is the same as a proof of inclusion and a merkle proof.\n\nHere is the text from the book:\n\n>Proof of membership. Another nice feature of Merkle trees is that, unlike the block chain that we built before, it allows a concise proof of membership. Say that someone wants to prove that a certain data block is a member of the Merkle Tree. As usual, we remember just the root. Then they need to show us this data block, and the blocks on the path from the data block to the root. We can ignore the rest of the tree, as the blocks on this path are enough to allow us to verify the hashes all the way up to the root of the tree. See Figure 1.8 for a graphical depiction of how this works.\n\nHere is a diagram they provide:\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/A5KKDJO.png](https://i.imgur.com/A5KKDJO.png)\n\nREBUTTAL: Consider a trivial example of a merkle tree where it contains 3 nodes.  It has a root. The root has 2 children(leaf nodes in this case). Also assume a merkle tree is structured as I claim: The leaf nodes contain hashes of their corresponding datablocks. The parents of these leaf nodes contain the hash of the concatenated child hashes. And any further parents are recursively constructed in the same fashion.\n\nGiven this simple case, let the datablocks be denoted as A and B. Then one leaf node contains H(A) and the other contains H(B). The parent contains the hash H( H(A) || H(B) ).\n\nI want to prove the membership of the datablock A. The book claims I need only provide the direct path from root to leaf node of A. And I claim this is NOT enough information. Suppose I do as the book states and provide the root and the leaf node containing H(A). First providing the leaf node H(A) is actually redundant. Anyone can fabricate the correct hash of a datablock on the fly. What we really want is a piece of information that confirms H(A) is indeed part of this tree where the hashes propagate upward to the root - and where the root is combined authenticator for all the elements in the tree. Ok so maybe adding the root will provide enough information? If I observe the hash stored in the root which is the output of H(H(A)||H(B)). Well this is NOT helpful! How can I confirm that H(A) was propagated upwards into the root and passed into a hash with H(B) concatenated. I have H(A), but I'm missing half of the input so how can I possibly reproduce the output of H(H(A)||H(B)) to verify? The only way to verify would be if I was provided H(B).\n\nI claim the information that must be provided are the sibling nodes along the direct route from leaf to root which contradicts the claims in the book.\n\nSOURCES\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/hA7fAzL.png](https://i.imgur.com/hA7fAzL.png)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/a4d6Z3h.png](https://i.imgur.com/a4d6Z3h.png)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/CmDs8tg.png](https://i.imgur.com/CmDs8tg.png)\n\n[https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/\\~raluca/cs261-f15/readings/merkleodb.pdf](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~raluca/cs261-f15/readings/merkleodb.pdf)\n\n======================\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/Tj8XEex.png](https://i.imgur.com/Tj8XEex.png)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/TSrdJaA.png](https://i.imgur.com/TSrdJaA.png)\n\n[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.07941](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.07941)\n\n======================\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/cLiRDAe.png](https://i.imgur.com/cLiRDAe.png)  \n[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2096720922000343](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2096720922000343)\n\n======================\n\nThe section on k-ary merkle trees puts further emphasis on the sibling requirements because the number of siblings grows with k.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/KRFxhTC.png](https://i.imgur.com/KRFxhTC.png)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/JgQ3Pvu.png](https://i.imgur.com/JgQ3Pvu.png)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/o0sZmGV.png](https://i.imgur.com/o0sZmGV.png)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/YoRIfxw.png](https://i.imgur.com/YoRIfxw.png)\n\n[https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/materials/2018/Kuszmaul.pdf](https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/materials/2018/Kuszmaul.pdf)\n\n======================\n\nHere is a merkle tree implementation and the getProof method demonstrates the siblings are returned AND it uses index arithmetic to locate the siblings rather than a \"hash pointer\" as described in book.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/3Nm7Mjg.png](https://i.imgur.com/3Nm7Mjg.png)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/mqOpYFB.png](https://i.imgur.com/mqOpYFB.png)\n\n[https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/merkle-tree/blob/master/src/core.ts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/merkle-tree/blob/master/src/core.ts)\n\n======================\n\nThis is a response to a question about how the merkle proof works and they walk through the steps pretty clearly with an actual example using hashes.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/icda30h.png](https://i.imgur.com/icda30h.png)\n\n[https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/69018/merkle-root-and-merkle-proofs](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/69018/merkle-root-and-merkle-proofs)", "content_size_bytes": 7693}

It’s like a stock market for real-world events.\n\n# Why does this matter for crypto?\n\n* They’re actually useful – Instead of just trading meme coins, prediction markets provide real-world value by showing what people *really* think will happen.\n* Less censorship – A lot of places ban certain types of betting (especially political betting), but decentralized markets are harder to shut down.\n* One of the best real uses for crypto – People always ask what crypto is actually *good for*. This is one of the best answers.\n* Better than traditional betting – No middlemen, lower fees, and the odds are set by the market instead of bookies.\n\nPlatforms like Polymarket and Augur are already doing this, but it still feels early.

Scaling has been a challenge due to its block size and consensus model (?)\n* **XRP**: Can handle up to **1,500 TPS**, making it more suitable for large-scale, high-frequency use cases like global payments.\n\n  \n**Purpose**:\n\n* **Bitcoin**: Designed as a **decentralized digital currency** and store of value, often referred to as \"digital gold.\"\n* **XRP**: Primarily developed as a **bridge currency** for cross-border payments and facilitating fast, low-cost transfers between financial institutions.\n\n# Combined Benefits for Financial Technology:\n\n1. **Improved Efficiency**: Bitcoin’s decentralization and XRP’s speed/low cost can complement each other in creating hybrid systems that are both secure and scalable.\n2. **Reduced Costs**: Both cryptocurrencies eliminate the need for traditional intermediaries, reducing inefficiencies in transaction and operational costs between countries.\n3. **Innovation in Payment Systems**: By integrating blockchain technology, Bitcoin and XRP can inspire new solutions for digital payments, lending, and \"**ASSET\"** tokenization.\n\n  \nSome questions that I have:\n\n1. Can both co-exist with each other later?  \n2. Is XRP decentralized or centralized?  \n\n* Validators on the XRP Ledger include universities, financial institutions, and independent organizations, making the network less reliant on Ripple Labs.\n* Since Ripple Labs created XRP and still holds a significant portion of its supply (over 40 billion XRP in escrow). This concentration of ownership can give Ripple Labs significant influence over the XRP market, defeat the purpose of decentralized currency like bitcoin.\n\n  \nPlease correct me if I have any mistakes and I hope we could learn from each other :) Thank you!", "content_size_bytes": 2954}

Oasis Protocol is addressing this by combining Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) with blockchain technology to deliver verifiable AI.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\n* **What Are TEEs?** TEEs are secure hardware environments that isolate sensitive data and computations, protecting them from unauthorized access or tampering. Think of them as a vault for processing data while keeping it private.\n* **Blockchain Integration**: By coupling TEEs with Oasis’s blockchain, computations performed inside these secure enclaves can be verified using cryptographic proofs. This guarantees that the AI models and their outputs haven’t been altered.\n* **Why It Matters**: This combination enables decentralized applications to maintain both transparency and privacy, solving a key issue for industries that rely on sensitive data, such as:\n   * **Healthcare**: Securely analyzing patient data without exposing it to breaches.\n   * **Finance**: Ensuring fraud detection algorithms operate as intended without bias or interference.\n   * **Government and Compliance**: Proving compliance with regulations while maintaining data confidentiality.\n\nOasis Protocol is paving the way for AI systems to gain trust in critical applications where verifiability is essential.

The core idea of this algorithm is to enhance both transaction confidentiality and user anonymity without compromising the integrity of the blockchain itself. This is achieved primarily through the use of pseudonyms for each transaction, and I'd love to explain how it works!\n\nKey Features:\n\n1. Pseudonyms for Sender and Receiver:\nEvery transaction on the blockchain involves a pseudo-generated public address for both the sender and the receiver. These pseudonyms are essentially temporary identities tied to a private key that can only be used for that specific transaction. By doing so, the blockchain ensures that there is no direct link between the user’s real-world identity and their on-chain activities, enhancing privacy.\n\n2. Transaction Fragmentation:\nTransactions are fragmented into smaller parts that are independently validated, meaning that even if parts of the transaction are intercepted, it becomes nearly impossible to reconstruct the full transaction. This ensures extra layers of security and privacy.\n\n3. Dual Validation by Two Groups of Miners:\nTo further enhance security, two separate groups of miners validate different aspects of each transaction. This reduces the risk of malicious actions and ensures that the integrity of the transaction is always maintained.\n\n4. Cryptographic Protections:\nI’ve incorporated zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), ring signatures, and other advanced cryptographic techniques to guarantee that transaction details remain private while still allowing for secure verification on the blockchain.\n\nWhy Pseudonyms?\n\nThe use of pseudonyms in this system allows for complete privacy—even when transactions are verified, there is no way to trace back the transaction to any real-world identity unless the user explicitly reveals it. This is a key feature for anyone concerned with maintaining their privacy in a blockchain environment.\n\nAdditionally, it provides a layer of security against tracking and surveillance by making it incredibly difficult to correlate transactions between different pseudonyms, even if they are used by the same person.\n\nWhat’s Next?\n\nI’m hoping to take this concept further and eventually bring it to the real world. The system is designed to be scalable, meaning it can grow alongside the adoption of blockchain technology while maintaining privacy and security for all users.\n\nIf you’re into blockchain tech, privacy, or cryptography, I’d love to hear your thoughts and any feedback you might have!\n\n\nThis blockchain algorithm uses pseudonyms for both sender and receiver, transaction fragmentation, and dual miner validation to ensure maximum privacy and security while maintaining a transparent and secure blockchain ledger.", "content_size_bytes": 2854}

The ones that do will probably only play a minor role in the future of finance. There’s a lot to say so I’ll focus on what I see as the fundamental issue: **trustless and decentralized financial systems, no matter how well-engineered, fail to meet basic user needs.**\n\nCrypto overlooks the need for **oversight and intervention**. Without it, systems become dangerously exploitable. Crypto wallets often lack government IDs and use irreversible, sometimes untraceable transactions, making them prime targets for theft. As adoption grows, so might scams, threats, and violence. Without oversight, crypto can also be used to hide and launder money, promoting tax fraud and other criminal behavior.\n\nTraditional bank accounts, in contrast, incorporate measures like withdrawal limits, fraud detection, transaction traceability and reversibility, and compliance checks (KYC and AML). These safeguards require centralized authorities with power and thus DeFi lacks foundational security.\n\nSome argue that crime is minimal relative to total crypto transactions. Yet crypto grants users the freedom to commit these crimes if they choose, and the ease of doing so could incentivize tax fraud and other crimes. So while I admit privacy is important, your actions can’t be totally anonymous. Crypto is akin to having no police in a city.\n\nUsers are also fully responsible for their private keys, and that responsibility often leads to lost or accidentally destroyed wallets. Proper storage means creating multiple backups and maintaining a highly secure physical environment—no small task, especially when millions of dollars could be on the line. For most people, it simply isn’t practical or safe to manage that level of risk themselves. The sensible solution, in my view, is to rely on a centralized, trustworthy entity—i.e., a bank.\n\nHopefully, this illustrates the flaws in DeFi and why banks and governments remain necessary. For those who still believe a trustless blockchain is the solution where users bank themselves, remember that today’s “trustless” blockchains aren’t truly trustless. Oracles—offchain data sources that link onchain—cannot be verified cryptographically. While aggregation from multiple oracles can reduce risk, collusion remains possible.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is that **trust is indispensable, despite its imperfections.** Instead of eliminating trust, we should focus on making our institutions more trustworthy—a far simpler approach. To replace TradFi, crypto would need to replicate thousands of centralized features in code—fraud resolution, asset recovery, tax compliance, oracle verification, criminal law, and more. This would require an enormous infrastructure of decentralized nodes running millions of lines bug-free code, making complex, nuanced decisions—well beyond current technology. And since “code is law,” human intervention would be nearly impossible when mistakes occur.\n\nMaybe once we reach AGI, decentralized altruistic AI agents could run the financial system. Until then, I remain skeptical that most cryptocurrencies have any real, lasting value.\n\nEDIT: I wrote this post right before learning that OpenAI announced o3, which some say is AGI 🙊 \n\nThere’s a lot I didn’t say because this is long enough but I think there is some good in blockchain via taking elements of it and applying them to centralized, permissioned systems.

We all know that multiple copies of the complete chain are held on mutiple machines (some explanations say \"by every device participating in the chain\" although I suspect thst is not really the case!) So, my first area of interest is the size of the chain / data storage requirements. I have no idea how much disk space a single block takes up, but that is largely irellevant. If a particular chain is old and popular, surely it wil evenbtually grow to a size that makes it impractical? Can anyone comment?\n2. The classic explanation of how a cryptocurrency works, is that the chain represents a ledger of all transactions. In order to figure out a particular address's balance (to see if they have enough to make a transaction) the explanation then basically states that the whole chain / ledger is scanned for transactions involving that address to calculate the balance. So, related to Q1, how is that done efficiently? I mean, if I have a chain that is (say) 10 years old, with several tens of billions of transactions in the ledger, wouldn't searching the chain for every transaction involving a particular address take an impractical amount of time? (Say, I have a waller running on my smartphone, how can it perform that search efficiently?) Or is there some clever algorithm in play here?\n3. How is the \"winning\" miner decided upon? Regardless of \"proof\" somehow one entitly must \"win\", sign the block, add it to the chain and claim the reward? Again, say we have several thousand miners (and nodes) it's not unreasonable for more thsan one to get a solution before consensus can be reached. Given that the whole point is to have no central control, who gets to decide? Doesn't network latency get in the way?\n4. I have a basic understanding of \"Proof of Work\" and how thi has led to a crazy amount of power being used on a glovbal scale for mining operations, but how do other systems work (\"Proof of Stake\" / \"Proof of Storage\" etc.) and why are they more efficient? Do they also not have to \"solve\" the block in the same way that PoW systems do?\n5. Who actaully executes smart contracts? By which I mean, where is the code actually run? Is it the miner? If so, how do we ensure that if the contract references external entites, it is only done once?\n\nThanks for reading this. Any insights you can offer would be greatly appreciatedf!", "content_size_bytes": 2545}

While I am continuing to broaden my understanding about crypto and the blockchain, I'm really interested in recommendations for some more specific research. Right now I have a massive funnel of information and I'm basically choking on it all.\n\nWhat really interests me is the potential for crypto and the underlying tech to make private equity and venture capital obsolete, as businesses, creators, and developers are able to use tokens to leverage their community as investors who want to directly support products/people/ideas they believe in and cut out the middle men of VC/PE and wall street (I currently hold stock in some VC/PE firms registered as BDCs because that's as close as I can get to those market opportunities, and also the whole \"accredited investor\" thing is BS, but I digress.) - something in between crowd funding and IPOs that are superior to both.\n\nI had an \"aha\" moment when I was learning about how smart contracts have been used to code royalties into NFTs and stuff, and realized that this technology is vastly superior to the current way that basically the whole stock market operates. In my hopium-fueled future, shareholder agreements are coded on the blockchain and stock is replaced with tokens - and obviously not just stocks, but all sorts of asset classes, IP, etc, that most people don't currently have good access too.\n\nI believe this is referred to as \"tokenization\" - but I'm still learning all the vocabulary - and also there seem to be a lot of different players out there talking about tokenization as part of their use case, but I'm not sure they all mean exactly the same thing or have the same vision for what that looks like.\n\nIf anyone could recommend specific cryptos that are working on this use, I will happily dive into them. I would prefer better known projects as opposed to deep-in-the-weeds altcoins, but if you think the technology is really compelling then I'm happy to look at it and learn even if only for my own edification and better understanding.\n\nThe four that I am currently studying are Ripple, Cardano, Chainlink, and Polkadot - not specifically for what I mentioned above, but because they're the ones that are on my current reading list, although they all do seem to have some aspect of tokenization to them (opinions on these welcome).\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n  \nP.S. This post got auto-modded off the cryptocurrency subreddit because I'm a massive lurker, but looking at the threads over here, it looks like an actual better fit and more likely to get substantive answers.

However, technically if an algorithm existed today, a quantum computer could start mining Bitcoin. I’m guessing that a quantum computer could calculate the target hash much faster than all the traditional computer on the network so the difficulty of the target hash would need to increase to maintain the 10 minute block target.\n\nIf my assumptions about the process above are correct (feel free to correct if I am misunderstanding), I’m curious what would happen to Bitcoin if this quantum computer stopped mining.

The idea is an escrow platform where:\n\n1. **Sellers submit a decryption key** to the escrow system.\n2. Buyers negotiate a deal (likely on a third-party platform).\n3. Once payment is confirmed, the decryption key is securely released to the buyer.\n4. The platform includes a **rating system** for buyers and sellers to build trust.\n\nKey Features:\n\n* No files or documents are stored on the site. Only a decryption key for said item.\n* Even if I wanted to investigate what’s being bought or sold, I wouldn’t be able to, since the files and transactions are separate. So 100% anon.\n* The system relies entirely on the **validity of the key** and the buyer’s ability to decrypt their file.\n\n# My Concerns:\n\nI’m worried there might not be enough demand for a system like this. It seems like there are limited use cases where total anonymity is essential.\n\n* Do you think this is a dumb idea?\n* Are there specific use cases or scenarios where this would make sense?\n* What would make you trust such a platform?\n\nSay you want to buy a digital good (e.g., a license key, encrypted document, or script) in complete privacy. The seller won’t just send it to you because they can’t be sure you’ll pay. That’s where our site comes in:\n\nThe seller encrypts the digital good and submits the **decryption key** to our site. The actual encrypted file remains wherever they choose—Dropbox, a USB stick, email—completely outside our platform. Once you’ve sent payment and it’s confirmed, the system releases the decryption key to you. You can then use the decryption key, on the encrypted file inorder to recieve your product.\n\n1. **Trust**: The seller is guaranteed payment, and you’re guaranteed the decryption key.\n2. **Anonymity**: Since we never handle or store the file, even we couldn’t determine what’s being bought or sold.\n3. **Security**: The process is entirely focused on the key, leaving the file’s storage up to the buyer and seller.\n\nOnly thing missing is the buyer needs to trust the seller, this I would use a rating/comment system for.\n\n  \nI’d really appreciate any constructive feedback or suggestions.

While Filecoin has made huge strides in the decentralized storage space, Cere Network’s Decentralized Data Cloud (DDC) offers some unique advantages that I believe could make it a more scalable, private, and efficient alternative in the long term. Here’s why:\n\n1. True Decentralization:\n\n\t•\tFilecoin operates with a reliance on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), which, while a powerful tool, still has issues around centralized bottlenecks—specifically, reliance on specific nodes for data retrieval. Cere Network is building its own decentralized storage layer, aiming for seamless on-chain data management, ensuring true decentralization without these limitations.\n\n2. Optimized for Scalability & Speed:\n\n\t•\tWhile Filecoin is good for long-term data storage, it struggles with real-time, high-speed data access, which is essential for Web3 applications and especially AI-driven projects. Cere’s DDC is engineered for high-throughput and low-latency access, enabling not just storage but real-time data sharing that’s critical for modern applications.\n\n3. Privacy-Focused for Enterprises and AI:\n\n\t•\tCere offers a far more robust approach for enterprises looking to securely share and manage sensitive data, whereas Filecoin lacks the same level of privacy integration. With data privacy becoming an even bigger issue, especially in AI development, Cere’s architecture allows secure data sharing, which is vital for the next-generation Web3 applications and AI algorithms.\n\nThe AI Angle & Potential Data Marketplace:\n\nOne of the most exciting aspects of Cere Network’s infrastructure is its potential to create a decentralized data marketplace. This could be a game-changer, especially as machine learning and AI continue to grow exponentially. Here’s how:\n\t1.\tDecentralized Data for AI Training:\nCere’s Decentralized Data Cloud (DDC) could be the foundation for a marketplace where custom datasets are bought and sold. AI models need massive, high-quality datasets to train on, but often, acquiring these datasets in a decentralized manner is complex and expensive. Cere Network could allow individuals or companies to upload, sell, or share their data securely, creating a new market for customized datasets that can be directly accessed by AI developers and machine learning practitioners.\n\t2.\tAccess to High-Quality Data for Machine Learning:\nMany organizations struggle to find curated datasets that are specific to their machine learning models, leading to delays and inefficiencies. With Cere, people could monetize their data in a way that is secure and transparent, providing AI developers with access to diverse, high-quality datasets that would previously have been difficult to acquire. This opens up new opportunities for cross-industry collaborations, allowing AI models to become more powerful and specialized.\n\t3.\tData Ownership and Control:\nOne of the major issues in the current landscape is data ownership. In many cases, the owners of valuable datasets (such as companies or individuals) don’t have control over how their data is shared or monetized. Cere’s infrastructure ensures that users can retain ownership of their data while still participating in a marketplace, where they can choose to license or sell access to it. This would ensure fair compensation for those providing data while fostering a new market for AI companies and machine learning developers.\n\nLocal Node Deployment and Custom Clusters:\n\nAnother groundbreaking feature that Cere Network offers is the ability to spin up local nodes and create custom clusters, giving users and developers the power to personalize their infrastructure in a way that is scalable and efficient. Here’s how this can revolutionize decentralized storage and data usage:\n\t1.\tSpin Up Local Nodes:\n\t•\tCere’s flexibility allows anyone to set up local nodes on their own hardware. This is a huge benefit because it reduces dependency on centralized providers and creates a truly decentralized ecosystem where users can participate from their own servers. Whether you’re an enterprise or an individual, the ability to host nodes locally means that Cere’s network can grow organically across different regions without relying on centralized cloud services.\n\t2.\tCustomizable Data Clusters:\n\t•\tCere goes beyond just providing data storage. It allows users to build and configure custom clusters that meet their specific needs—whether that’s handling particular types of datasets, optimizing for machine learning workloads, or even tailoring the storage configuration for specific AI applications. This is a huge advantage for developers looking for more control over their infrastructure and those who require high-performance data access for complex tasks.\n\t3.\tSeamless Scalability for Enterprises and AI:\n\t•\tAs demand for data increases, being able to scale your local node infrastructure is key. Cere Network provides an easy way to expand clusters dynamically, ensuring that enterprise-level applications, especially those leveraging AI and machine learning, have access to unlimited scalability without being constrained by traditional centralized models.\n\nWhy This Could Be a Game-Changer:\n\nWith the rise of AI, the demand for large-scale, diverse, and privacy-compliant datasets is skyrocketing. Cere Network isn’t just building a decentralized storage layer; it’s positioning itself as a deep layer infrastructure project that could lay the foundation for a global decentralized data marketplace. By creating an ecosystem where data providers and AI developers can securely exchange data, Cere can unlock a massive revenue stream while also driving forward the development of AI.\n\nBy allowing custom node setups and the ability to deploy clusters locally, Cere can offer unmatched scalability and flexibility for decentralized data storage. This could lead to the creation of a decentralized infrastructure capable of handling the most demanding AI applications, enabling developers and businesses to access data on their own terms.\n\nWhat Do You Think?", "content_size_bytes": 6244}
